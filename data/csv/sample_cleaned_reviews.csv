0,271781,bluejacket74,"750 ml bottle, 2016 vintage, bottle #304 of 360. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisin, plum), chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of licorice. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with some coffee flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, worth picking up if you want a nice straight forward imperial stout. Here's hoping Four String brings this back in the future! $9.99 a bottle."
3,125646,GratefulBeerGuy,"0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose"" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's."
4,125646,LukeGude,Classic TH NEIPA. Overflowing head and bouquet. Strong flavor but smoother than 8.2%. Maybe peach nose but overall a general citrus punch.
7,125646,MFMB,"Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a Nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again. By far my favorite Treehouse brew of the 4 or 5 I’ve had."
13,125646,jngrizzaffi,"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Has a big juicy citrus aroma. Nice juicy taste with a good amount of citrus and some piney resin at the end. Bitterness is spot on. A little on the heavy side, but excellent. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
15,125646,PDOR1960,Another great brew from Treehouse!!
19,125646,Lucular,"Pours with a cloudy yellow-orange haze with a burst of tropical fruit in the aroma and flavor. Overall not quite as flavorful as I had hoped and the alcohol comes through which is a surprise. Missing the mark of the typical TH pillowy mouthfeel as well. Consumed at just past 3 weeks, possibly past its prime."
28,205644,Brutaltruth,"From the tall boy can and enjoyed in a snifter via a friend from work---THANKS JUSTIN! This unique brown pours a deep muddy blackish brown with an excellent head of dark tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, modest pool, and features some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of coconut milk, cocoa, and light cola notes. Flavors lightly exceed the nose with deeply roasted coconut with dark cola and cocoa flavors with a touch of chicory note to it on the rear of the taste. Nice mouth feel; coating, medium carbonation, medium body, and a bitter malt finish with just of touch of herbal hops. Overall it is a nice unique little brew. Cheers"
32,205644,secondtooth,"Appearance: Pours a deep black, with tan head and very little lace. Aroma: Chocolate malts, coconut seeping in…pretty appealing. Taste: Rich! Sweet with plenty of coconut and cocoa, but with something different..a twist. There’s also a spiciness, like chicory in there…like a root beer spice. This one is really packed with deep flavor, rich and unusual. Not your father’s coconut brown ale, yes. Delicious, for sure!"
36,150672,Derek,"Beautiful, crystal clear pour with a nice head. Good retention, awesome lace. Pleasant citrus aroma, but not as powerful as some. Real good flavour here, lots of late hops, with a good bitterness and a light hop acidity. Thanks Yardsale!"
37,150672,byronic,Poured a bit lively and had to wait for it to settle very nice lacing. Slightly hazy golden straw. Floral notes maybe a hint of citrus. Quite smooth on the palate a touch bitter and definitely a pungent finish as advertised. Somewhat of a dry finish and something about the lingering taste is off. The mouth coating is a touch creamy.
39,150672,Coronaeus,"355ml can. Bright copper with a dense foamy head that dissipates slowly leaving thin lacing. Pine, lemon, lime on the nose. Forceful bitterness upfront with blended citrus flavours dominating. Medium body. Very nice."
43,150672,wanderingspirit,"Quite balanced and distinct IPA of a West Coast style IPA from this small prairie city brewery. Packs a punch at 7abv but the bite is layered by pine and citrus aroma and taste, but a nice malt finish and stands up to many west coast IPAs. Nice start for Black Bridge."
44,150672,Phyl21ca,Can: Poured a clear amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops notes with some light dry caramel malt notes. Taste is also dominated by citrusy hops notes with medium bitter notes with some dry caramel malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Slightly better than your standard IPA.
48,150672,Sathanas,"Can bought online from Liquor Direct. Drank it warm. Dank. Juicy. A little bit of bitterness. A bit of caramel, honey and biscuit. Perfectly balanced. Sound good? Yeah... yeah it does. 7% abv but drinks like a 4% ISA. Easily one of the best standard IPA's I've had from Canada. Cheers!"
50,150672,KingHoppy,"Passing through Swift Current SK, I stopped at Original Joe's for a late night meal. Many times previously, they had no IPAs whatsoever so I almost didn't ask but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised they were now carrying the hometown craft beer IPA! by Black Bridge Brewery. Notes of citrus, pine, floral, everything you could want in an IPA and with a respectable 7% alcohol kick as well. Very well balanced with the malt. Immediately it was one of my favorite American style IPAs. The next day I went to the Swift Current liquor store and bought three 4-packs. I haven't seen it outside of Swift Current, SK but since it's a new brewery they will surely expand to other locations. If you're passing through Swift Current, you got to try this beer - otherwise keep your eyes open for it in your local beer store."
53,150672,Bunman3,"Yes, please! I've been hoping to find Black Bridge for a while and it was certainly worth the wait. This is a well-constructed, subtle IPA. The malt and hops wrassle happily to create an extremely pleasant beer. I am looking forward to sampling the rest of this brewery's lineup!"
56,150672,sasky7777,A well put together hoppy ale. Easy drinking and great aroma and flavour. It hits everything you would look for in an IPA
59,150672,biboergosum,"355ml can, the latest from this nascent craft brewery from Swift Current, Saskabush. This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber hue, with four flabby fingers of puffy, rocky, and somewhat bubbly bone-white head, which leaves some exploded bike chain lace around the glass as things quickly subside. It smells of pungent, and sort of dank piney, leafy hops straight off, with a strong pithy orange, white grapefruit, and lemon rind citrus fruit abettor, some chalky flintiness, and a middling grainy caramel malt sweetness. The taste is gritty, grainy pale and semi-sweet caramel malt, a muddled green forest floor detritus bitterness, musty orange, lemon, and pineapple citrus notes, a still persistent earthy flintiness, and the suggestion of a hint of a wisp of metallic warming alcohol. The carbonation is fairly peppy and engaging in its low-key fizzy and outright frothy nature, the body an adequate medium weight, and more or less smooth, the hops displaying some down-home hospitality, they are. It finishes off-dry, the malt not ready to cede the flag just yet, while the hops start a campaign to consider a plan to circle the wagons. A pleasantly rendered, high-octane IPA, the hops more prevalent up top, but that's ok, the beer overall doesn't lag as a result, like some. Anyways, nice to see another well made local-ish IPA, and in cans to boot - hope to see this still around next summer, when I finally try to get back out camping, toddler in tow."
62,311190,Rub_This_BBQ,"look is great dark with a nice creamy head, but down hill from there. Overall for the ABV and style it feels me wanting more. The nose is muted and the taste follows very little malt or stout like flavors. Great pour but seems more a gimmick then a great beer"
69,104824,Fcolle2,"Batch 209 Pours thick dark viscous black in color with a thin fizzy film of a head that disappears rather quickly. Smell has some decadent rich caramel and toffee aromas along with a bourbon soaked raisin sweet aroma and lightly tart dark red cherry aroma.Tons of vanilla tannins and barrel notes are balanced along side some light roasted marshmellow, and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose with a big caramel and toffee sweetness hitting the palat first along side some fig and date flavors. Loads of vanilla tannin and toasted marshmellow come out along with some oak barrel and bourbon flavors,roasted malt, a walnut like nutty flavor and moderate amounts alcohol in the finish. Super tastey. Mouthfeel is really rich and creamy, a nice sipping beer. Completely costs the mouth with sticky sweet goodness."
73,104824,kevanb,"12oz bottle poured into a Pipeworks snifter. The beer pours a jet black color and has extreme opacity with a very thick texture. A thin but taut khaki head rises that has decent retention and leaves some spotted lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, plenty of vanilla bean, lots of toasted coconut, lots of earthy wood with light bourbon, chocolate is bittersweet and brings out both a light roast quality and some hazelnuts. It's very complex but easily approachable and inviting. The flavors are just as impressive, massive coconut presence with some strong vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, charred wood with a bit of chalkiness in small doses. The body is a bit lighter than I expected, very silky and it coats the mouth well while the finish is delicate and smooth. Verdict: An absolute stunner from Pipeworks. A textbook example of improving upon a base beer using barrels, adds not only complexity but depth. The balance of flavors is wonderful, everything in harmony, both sweet and earthy. This is easily my favorite Pipeworks beer to date and a remarkably good stout."
77,104824,Kevinpitts,"Really awesome Pipeworks brew. Not suprising as the regular Games of Jones is so good. Tastes like a good barrel aged beer, but with some sweet chocolate flavor. Unique barrel aged offering. Definitely worth a try."
86,74580,icehawk,"Bottle (from stfun) Appearance: Opaque black with short lasting off-white head Aroma: Fruity, alcohol, chocolate Taste: Fruity, banana undertones, with slightly bitter dark chocolate flavors Palate: Full mouthfeel, slightly chalky, unique cocoa like bitterness, but finishes sweet and dry. Overall: Interesting porter that brings in some elements that make it quite enjoyable and different than ""american"" porters."
95,74580,secondtooth,"Pours a dark ruby, with a small head of tan bubbles. Minimal lacing. Nose is roasty and fruity, and the body is light, even watery. Flavor is toffee up front, with some roasty chocolate in there as well. Maybe this isn't super unique or standout, but it does go down smoothly, and Backyard Porter is a faithful and flavorful English-style porter."
107,74580,grogged,"On tap at the Red Lion Grog House. Served in 16 oz glass w/ Fountain Square Brewing logo. Pours a deep brown with a creamy tan head that looks delicious. The smell was fragrant, almost earthy, yet slight off. Roasted coffee comes to mind, but there's an industrial whiff to it also. The mouthfeel is different. The carbonation stands out noticeably and not for the better. Full, yet fizzy and inconsistent. The coffee taste comes to the fore and so does the bitterness. The problem I had with this beer is that the bad carbonation notes and the bitterness linger too long in the brut(al) finish. I can love a beer that's slightly off, but this one was too far off for me. A drain pour."
108,74580,aasher,"On draft at McKenzie River off of 82nd St. This arrived a medium bodied coca brown in color on the verge of black with a one finger cream colored head. The nose features slight coffee, slight dark chocolate, and bitter roast. It solid, more bitterness than most. The flavors feature coffee and cream first and foremost. The chocolate is light subtly sweet. It finishes off dry and bitter. It drinks smoothly and between light and medium in body. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice first experience from this brewer. I'll try more of their beers in the future."
109,58482,Imstillthegman,"This one pours a cloudy rusty orange with about a fingers worth of off-white head. The head quickly faded to a ring, but left nice lacing. The aroma is a basic version of what I had hoped for. Sweet fruit and candi sugar with a bit of peppery yeast and a herbal/floral hop note. Not bad, just doesn't wow me. The flavor is quite enjoyable. I get the yeast right up front quickly followed by the sugars and fruit (pear and apple). The yeast comes back into play again with a nice pepper bite before I get the earthy hops. Active carbonation keeps the flavor going after the swallow. Not too bitter, more dry and white peppery. Very enjoyable brew that I will pick up again."
110,205644,Jaypeajus,"Not sure what to expect except I look forward to coconut..looks ok, not much head retention, much darker than brown, but I'm new to brown ales. First smell is like a smokey bock, whiffs of chocolate, tastes of charred chocolate cinnamon burnt banana slight mintyness, smokehouse flavors but not much of any coconut to me, bummed a bit about that. Feel is viscous not much in the hop register leaves a smokey residue on the tongue and mouth. Overall pretty complex very drinkable but no coconut and I only bring it up cos the label says it. Oh it does say toasted coconut so maybe that's all the smokiness. First burn em brew and it was good."
116,205644,Discos2,"16oz can>pint glass A- rich dark brown with a light khaki head. Great lacing. S- very sweet roasted malt smell with hint of toasted coconut. T- sweet, brown sugar, not overwhelming at all with coconut. Toasted coconut a bit in finish. F- smooth with a bit of boldness. O- very nice brown ale. Another A+ offering from burn'em."
117,205644,richj1970,"Poured from 16 oz can into nonic pint. No visible date. A: Dark black with 2-3 finger dense light tan head with excellent retention and leaving some nice lacing. S: Aroma is a bit subdued, but some coconut and chocolate are most prominent. T: Sweet roasted malts mixed with coconut and chocolate. Some hazelnut lingering around in the back. M: Full bodied but not heavy. Creamy texture with an almost milk shake quality to it. O: Very nice brown ale. Refreshing and easy drinking with a flavor profile I really enjoy."
122,206623,rodbeermunch,"Dark brown pour, not the thickest, its a wee heavy, not a stout. Real thin 1/8"" of tan head, whisps away quickly. Nice aroma, possibly the best part of the beer, good irish malt feel, bourbon and oak plenty strong but not overly done. Smooth taste, relatively easy drinking, good bourbon delivery vessel. Mild roasted malt notes, dark fruit way in the back, not overripe, not bitter, pretty smooth, carbonation spot on. Good stuff, nice use of barrel in this one."
123,206623,ivegot3Dvision,"I enjoyed this more than I thought I was going to. L: Slightly dark, exactly what I was expecting. S: Light barrel character, caramel, maple, sweet malt. T: Dark fruit, light bourbon, malty, sweet with little to no hop flavor. F: A little lighter than I was hoping, but the base beer isn't very heavy (heh) in the first place. Just the right amount of carbonation. O: I really enjoyed this, I think it will age well. About the previous reviewers note about pruno: obviously you've never had pruno, this is very, very far from pruno."
125,206623,deford,Poured from a bomber into a Firestone Walker Tulip. Just a tad darker in color than caramel and hazy. Quite strong alcohol on the nose...like pruno....smells like I'm in County Jail. Taste follows with a very sweet barrel presence. Mouthfeel is smooth. Finishes like a weak Bourbon....overall easy to drink.
127,174137,JerzDevl2000,"11 1/2 years on here and never did I review a beer in a crowler, until today. Someone I trade with got me this a while back and I finally got around to cracking this 32 oz'er down on this cool morning. I'll give any brewery in my home state a go and for a first impression, this wasn't that bad. Not much information was given on the can except that Village Idiot was located in Mount Holly and that the ABV was 6.8%, and not the 6.5% listed on here... Nice pour to this, as the beer had a deep and hazy golden hue to it, with plenty of head on top to boot. Deep rings of soapy lacing were left behind as the head had a nice retention as I worked my way through this. Not a strong aroma to this but there was a good amount of honey sweetness present to draw me in. Metallic hops, citrus pith, and a grassy undertone all combined for an unusual, but relatively pleasing taste that was pretty full while making this beer seem more like a balanced Pale Ale than an IPA. A low amount of carbonation, spicy malt presence like bread, and medium body kept this from feeling too heavy though this could have been a bit more balanced! Just the right amount of alcohol in here given the massive size of this. Nice job on this beer as I'm intrigued as to what else these guys are capable of. Time to start canning and getting more New Jersey breweries onto the proverbial map!"
138,96331,dirtylou,"on-tap @ the brewery I believe this is different than some similarly named DIPA's that have surfaced from Bainbridge - the board at the brewery suggested this was brewed for their 1st anniversary (though not technically their ""first anniversary beer""). Sticky, dank hops - moderate bitterness, nice sugary citrus, doughy malt."

144,58482,Kadonny,"Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. A: A nice cloudy gold color with a nice one finger white fluffy head. Nice glass lacing. S: Sweet fruits with some candy sweetness and a nice floral hop smell. Not overly complex, but nice. T: Sweeter fruits start first with hints of pear, apple, orange followed by a deep candy sweetness and maybe some bubblegum. A nice yeasty spicy funk is tasted and then you get this massive hop hit. Tastes of floral spicy earthy hops linger at the finish and leave a nice bitterness. Not overly complex again, but very nice. M: Medium and coating with some prickly aspects. Nice lingering bitterness. D: High, these are really drinkable, and the abv is totally hidden. Overall this beer is a tweener to me, but a perfect tweener. It's hoppier than a BPA, but not as hoppy as a Belgian IPA. It really is a great beer that is really enjoyable. Dan, this beer is wonderful, I love it. If you brew it regularly, I will buy it. A damn fine beer that is a nice mix between a Belgian and an American that is very enjoyable and drinkable. Good stuff!"
145,58482,Sammy,"On-tap at Mr. Goodbar's. Some yeast aroma. White soapy head on light orange body. Medium mouthfeel. Smooth, and spicey, corriander, a little cloves and pepper.A little bannana. A little hoppy and drying in the finish. An average beer overall, likely better with food."
146,58482,Lexluthor33,"A hazy,golden color with a really nice looking head and lace. The aroma of spice,grain and fruit/gum. The taste is sweet bubblegum flavor with only a touch of bitterness that is overcome by a good helping of hops. Some citrus notes as well. The feel is light to medium body with a smooth ending.Medium carbonation. Notes: Not Belgian,but still a very good beer."
147,58482,jamie2dope,"Here we go again, another brew from Weyerbacher. This one is a Belgian Pale, which is a hit or miss style for me. Clear orange in color, with a decent amount of white head. Lots of bubbles are racing to the top of this beer. Musty smells start things off and stay throughout, with traces of fruit thrown in here and there. More phenols in the taste, along with some grapefruit-esq hops, and a dry finish. Medium bodied, this is one crisp and refreshing Belgian beer. Drinking it is pretty damn easy too. Here we have another winner from Weyerbacher. Keep up the good work guys."
148,58482,dogfishandi,"MY 100TH REVIEW kinda wish i couldve had a little better beer than this for the 100th, but the next 2 should make up for it. pours a hazy glowing orange amber color. big fluffy head, almost pure white faded to a ring half way through the glass. just a touch of lacing. in the aroma your hit with big bubblegum and bananna from the yeast, some spiciness, floralness, from the hops i imagine. the aroma almost reminds me of the flouride u used to get from the dentist when you were a kid. for the taste you get some of the belgian yeast character, flouride taste, and then you get a lot of american hops. the 2 flavors combined create a kind of spiciness, almost peppery if you will. finishs a dry bitter spicy flavor that lingers. seems more like a belgian APA. doesnt seem to have the soft fluffy goodness of the true belgian PAs. for this i go down in the score a little, still a very good beer. smooth mouthfeel, medium body. good carb. but just not the same as an authentic belgian. good drinkability."
149,58482,DanielClouser,"I recently thought about the idea of toning down the bold new Belgian IPA style to a Belgian APA. I think Weyerbacher had the same idea, and Zotten is the result, as it is not consistent with the classic BPA style. Overall, it was very successful, but there was a pervasive grassy sort of bitterness in the flavor that really hurt the brew (especially its drinkability). I think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer, as it otherwise has potential to be excellent."
150,58482,Patrick999,"Pours an attractive shiny pale copper, like a penny. Copious bubblegum in the nose, some clove. I thought it was an impressive strong aroma. Nice flavor, a Belgian pale with much of the sweet bubblegum flavor, cut with a dose of citrusy American hops. A flavorful little beer. It doesn't feel as light and pillowy as a from-Belgium Belgian pale, but few American interpretations of the style do. Good beer. I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I do."
151,58482,JohnQVegas,"Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Pours a hazy bright copper, just a bit on the dark side, with a thin, fizzy off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Nose is nice - tangy tropical fruit and spices (coriander?), c-hops come though citrusy and pungent. Yeast comes through tangy and just a bit peppery. I like this one, though the northwestern hops tend to steal the show just a bit - they could be toned back a tad. Or at least made cleaner, their pungency is what's holding this one back. Taste carries more notes of lightly pungent c-hops, citrus and tropical fruit, big and spicy yeast note, peppery even. Light to moderate bitterness towards the finish that carries with the peppery, spicy note on the finish. Interesting, but the c-hops really take an overly heavy hand with this one in my opinion - give me a Belgian pale with grassy noble hops any day of the week. Not as subtle as I'd like it to be, but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is ok. The hops are laid on a little thick and rob the beer of the lightness I was hoping for, the body being a bit full as a result. Not as dry as I was hoping for either. Drinkability is pretty nice. When they say Belgian Pale Ale, I think they mean, Belgian-influenced American Pale Ale, not Belgian Pale Ale as in the traditional Belgian style. At least that's my take on it anyway. Still, not exactly what I would call a resounding success - not every style is made better with a big punch of American hops. Leads me to wonder what a classic like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which isn't quite as heavy handed with the hops, would do with such a treatment. Compared to the classics of the style like Orval, though, this one isn't even close."
152,58482,wiseguy142,"Pretty good looking. Amazing viscous head, lasts a while with some quickly dried up foamy lacing. Not a big fan of the color.. sort of a stereotypical beer color but there's nothing wrong iwth it. The aroma is almost too much for my 1 unclogged nostril to handle. Sort of a pungent Belgian smell. I'm not a huge Belgian fan in general and it comes off to me as smelling like bleach. Otherwise very floral to sort of an extreme, like smelling a scented candle. The taste again follows the bleachy smell. Maybe I'm sensitive to this because some of my early homebrews had problems with phenols, but this is a phenol phuck phest. Sweet and tart around the edges with a hint of alcohol. You can tell the beer is bottle conditioned because it feels a bit foamy immediately when it enters your mouth. Drinkability not so much. I'm having trouble finishing this. I don't think it's bad per say. I read in BA mag that some people were claiming it's too young and I think I tend to agree. Never been a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales in the first place- the Belgians I really like are the Strong Dark Ales but I wanted to try this out. I'm going to save the rest of the 4-pack for a few months and try again."
153,58482,hosehead83,"poured into a traditional pint glass Big billowy head-Deep gold to golden brown in color Aroma-Sweet malt, faint hop aroma Taste-Definite maltiness with an underlying English mineral hop flavor and a Belgian ""tang"" throughout--Abit unbalanced for my tastes, a bit more hop infusion would have evened things up some, but upon warming the flavors seemed to meld together a bit better. Overall, not too bad and certainly worth a try."
154,58482,TurtleCove,"12oz bottle bought as part of a mix pack from local beer distributor. Poured into a Duvel tulip, great looking beer. Deep golden honey brown, expected cloudiness from lees. Three finger white head, fine bubbles, subsides slowly to good lacing. Smell is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale, yeast, spice and citrus, maybe a hint of melon and banana too. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and almost creamy form the fine carbonation. Taste, like smell, is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale with great yeast and a slight hoppy finish. One interesting, and very pleasant, flavor note is a slight herby flavor reminiscent of fresh dill. Eminently drinkable."
155,58482,callmemickey,"A: Murky pale orange-amber body. Moderate offwhite cap, little lacing... Not as robust as I expect from the style. S: Mild candied sugars, banana and yeast. Soft and rounded. T: More of the same. Pleasant, if not bland. Lacking in the depth to elevate to the next level. Mostly breaded malts and soft banana / yeast notes. M: Smooth. Clean finish. D: Easy drinking... overall the beer falters from its lack of sophistication and assertiveness... a solid beer nonetheless."
156,58482,techcommdood,"Pours a hazy dirty gold color with quite a bit of head (2+ fingers), and quickly reduces to a thin layer of light foam at the surface. Moderate lacing on the glass. A bit of a funky color, almost like 50/50 lemonade/iced tea. Strong malty nose with coriander, citrus, and peppercorn. Slight wildflower notes. Dry hoppy taste with malted barley, citrus zest, coriander, and a touch of black pepper. Mouthfeel is surprisingly mellow and juicy at first, but turns to dryness afterward. About average drinkability on this one. Overall, a good session ale."
157,58482,ToddT,"A- Slightly cloudy, pale orange/copper color with a two finger cream head. Head is sticky and leaves some lacing on the glass. S- Fruit, bubblegum, spice, sugar, and bananas. Mild in aroma. T- Taste is much more powerful than the aroma would have you think. Tart fruit right away, then a mild sweetness with spice follows to tone it down. This is quickly followed by an unexpected bitter hop bite. The aftertaste wavers between bitter, sweet, and astringent. M- Medium in body and well carbonated. Finish is clean but unusual with the lingering bittersweet tastes. D- Alcohol is well hidden and at 6% ABV it is pretty drinkable. I'm not sure if I would be able to session this one though. Tastes a little out of balance and not as smooth as I would expect a Belgian style to be. The finish is the flaw for me. Worth trying."
158,58482,maximum12,"Big thanks to AgeofQuarrel for sending this brew to Minnesota; I've been on the lookout for it & am excited to finally have this in my greedy, slightly dirty little hands (I was pulling weeds earlier). Pours an interesting pale orange hue, a bit like me when I've been out in the sun too long. A pass of the glass beneath my ass (nose) yields an interesting amalgam of the wheatiness of a hefe & the yeastiness of a Belgian. Interesting beer. The taste is a perfect mirror of the smell: Belgian candy & yeast, with a grassy, wheatishness that would be comfy in a hefe. Beneath the surface there are some summer fruits, & spices, maybe a bit of banana & cinnamon or something to contribute some depth & interest. Tart & dry on the tongue, with a mid-July taste that begs for a lawn chair & a copy of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Very good brew. Glad to have tried another Weyerbacher experiment, & a successful one at that. Start sending some of these north!"
159,58482,Nickls,"(From notes) A - Very thin, pure white foamy head; burnt orange/light rust color S - Citric; yeasty; bit of banana bread T - Bready yeastiness; darker fruit flavors; dry vinous finish M - Medium to thinner; fine, subtle carbonation D - Just a touch too heavy in the body against the style for me; and the dry/yeasty combo just didn't really demand more from me. Not an overly complex brew, but nice in certain aspects."
160,58482,cjgator3,"12oz bottle A- Poured into a snifter. Pours a orangish amber color with an off-white head. S- The aroma is pale malts with a nice fruitiness as well as some spices and yeast. T- The taste follows suit with some pale malt that is enhanced by a mild peppery spiciness and a touch of citrus. The finish is dry with a dry and earthy finish. M- The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed this one. I think it is a great Belgian Pale Ale that is definitely worth picking up. Recommended!"
161,58482,cvstrickland,"Zotten pours brightly clear and brassy golden in color with a finger's thickness of grainy white foam atop. Steady streamers feed a slumping bubble-cap that retains at a thick sheet and deposits sliding lacing onto the sides of my shaker pint glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with prominent peach-infused notes of spice-sprinkled sweet green banana. A light graininess laced with fresh-cut grass gains in stature as the drink progresses. The taste is mildly sweet and non-denominationally fruity with a wink of peppery spice and a stiff grassy bitterness that dries the finish. A mellow yeasty nuttiness provides earthy grounding for the profile. The drink is medium in body with crisp carbonation and is quite drinkable."
162,58482,LilBeerDoctor,"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. On draft. Pours a cloudy orange with a small head. Aroma is heavy, sweet, and lots of melon. Flavor of sweet hops initially with tropical fruits, bready malt (corn?) and melon and yeast in the finish. Not bad but I wasn't a fan of the aroma."
163,58482,jsanto,"s - 4 pack, bottles. served in a konings hoven goblet. a - looking at a light golden beer with a little head, but that is fine. s - light orange and slight alcohol.hint of spice. t - citrus spice beer. beer flavor. m - carbonation and alcohol citrus beer flavor. d - verry enjoyable beer to drink. the 4-pack was just enough."
164,58482,Casey10,"A - Golden color S - Earthy musky smell T - Wow a lot of different tones here earthy, wheat and raisons maybe. M - foamy light crisp tate D - Don't know if I would drink a lot of these but a nice representation of style. This is light beer that is a nice representation of the style that it is creating. I liked this beer but it did not blow me away."
168,58482,koopa,Bottle shared with beerloco. Appearance: orange amber with pale honey folds. A nice white 2 finger head with some retention and lacing. Smell: Some bubblegum and banana phenols with a spicy yeast and pale malt. Taste: Loads of delicious bubblegum and banana notes...is this a pale ale or a wheat beer!!! Nice belgian yeast with some spicyness to it. Earthy yet a touch sweet. Mouthfeel: Medium body with a nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability: Tasty and only 6% abv I was pleasantly surprised by this one and will try it again sometime.
169,58482,Slatetank,"I picked this up at Thirsty's in East York, PA. Poured chilled into a goblet. A - Dark honey amber w/ a pale 2 finger cap w/ a fine bead. Subtle lacing and a film remains when the head settles. S - Slightly phenolic aroma w/ spice and fruit notes in equal measure w/ a Belgian yeast nose that has slight banana esters M - Mild spiciness w/ mild carbonation and slightly bitter feel w/ a dry finish T - A mild hop is nestled under a spiced yeast flavor w/ mild tropical fruit note from the yeast w/ a gentle sweet flavor from the malt. A light biscuit influcence is tasted toward the end D - A good belgian pale, but a flavor that didn't wow me. I wish it had mor malt & hops than yeast. The drinkability was average to me, I would try it again if I saw it on tap."
170,58482,Pencible,"This poured a hazy copper color with fluffy light tan head. It smelled like fresh wheat and wild yeast and lemon hops, with candi sugar and salty cloves and earthy caramel. It tasted like sour lemon and wild yeast, with copper and caramel and fresh wheat, along with a bit of coriander and clove. It was fairly thin with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean taste that started out a bit overly sour, but became richer and smoother as it warmed. It had a nice balance of spices, and decent body, so it was easy to drink. It seems like not many Belgian ales are offered for under 7% ABV anymore, but this one is a solid option."
171,200826,ShanePB,"Served on draft at Spring House Brewing Co. Reddish pink colored body with a quickly dissipating head. No lacing or retention. Aromas of cranberry, oak, white wine and sourness. Flavor is a bit more muted with the fruit flavor than the nose would lead you to believe. Delicate hints of cranberry along with a wash of sourness. Not much wine on the taste, either. The peach version of this is way, way better."
173,74580,tsauce2,"P: On-tap in to a 16 oz cup. A: SRM is dark brown. Semi-translucent. Head is tan, 1 in, dissipates to outsides of the beer. Medium carbonation. Medium lacing. S: Rich dark malt base with a touch of the classic porter smell. Light coffee notes and a touch of hops. T: Dark malt, light roastiness, with a bit of the classic porter bite and a natural malt flavor. Light hops. Crisp and clean flavors. M: Medium body. Roasted malts give a balanced and slightly creamy feel. Semi-dry finish. O: Very drinkable and a good example of an American Porter. This beer is nicely executed. I would like to see this beer on-tap around the city in more locations. I will order this beer any time I see it available."
175,74580,JamesS,"On tap at the Tomlinson Tap Room. Poured a wonderful deep, shiny brown, with some very excellent tan head and some nice lacing. Good deep dark malt scent with roasted grains and a lot of coffee. Huge coffee flavors, slight chocolate tones, and a nice earthy finish; very nice roasted grains; just slightly unbalanced from the coffee. Went down quite nicely."
177,259020,AdmiralOzone,"Pours a murky apricot color with a small off white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is the highlight of this beer, smells of tangerine, grapefruit and marmalade. The flavor is very sweet and malty with hardly any hop bitterness. No date on this can but presumably fairly fresh. The feel is fine, but overall a beer that I won't purchase (but wouldn't turn down if someone brought me some)."
178,259020,Czequershuus,"This beer pours a medium amber with an average head. The aroma features notes of pineapple, mandarin oranges, grapefruit peel, and caramel. The flavor is quite sweet upfront with caramel notes, followed by candied pineapple, overripe mango, peach, and a a burnt sugar finish. The mouthfeel is medium with abundant foam y carbonation. Overall this is a bit of a muddled beer, with too much sweetness and slightly off hop flavors. Decent, but not something I would get again."
180,259020,pat61,"L: pours brilliant copper amber producing a 1"" light cream colored foam collar with fair retention. S: smells like green tea, fruit, light malt, citrus and tropical fruit. It pours brilliant copper amber producing a 1"" light cream colored foam collar with fair retention. T: It starts with a light prickle on the tongue, tropical fruit, green tea, and lightly sweet fruit up front. Medium high hops emerge mid-palate leading to a slightly green tea astringent, drying bitter finish. F: medium body and medium high carbonation. O: This is a very drinkable beer but could use a little less carbonation."
184,259020,NilocRellim,"Clear bright amber colour, light citrusy hop nose and a little sweet, medium to heavy bodied, sweet and heady malt body throughout. Prominent earthy and citrusy hop finish which lingers. Slightly alcoholic in taste but not bitter."
201,311190,woodychandler,"I just wrapped up my stated intention for New Beer Sunday (Week 687) & while I was not done for the day, I decided to close out there. The CANQuest (tm) CANtinues with this N2 CAN. From the CAN: ""The Can That You Shake!""; ""Keep Me Ice Cold""; ""Get Whipped[:] 1[)] Gently Shake the Can to Activate Nitrogen. 2[)] Open Then Invert Can Over Your Glass And Pour Hard."" I had kept it cold, but I read in several places that agitation led to gushing so I erred on the side of caution. My Crack! & inverted Glug may have been a bit less aggro than the brewers intended, but it all seemed to work out. I got a decent cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, deep-brown head with excellent retention, still hanging in as I type. Color was dead Black/Opaque (SRM =44), allowing ZERO light penetration. In fact, I thought that it might be sucking the light out of the room. Nose was definitely chocolate, but it was a dark/baker's/semi-sweet chocolate. This was no playing around, especially with its ABV. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. The taste was rich and chocolaty, but really smoky and bitter. Whew! Finish was definitely dry and bitter, but with a lingering chocolate aspect."
204,311190,argock,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a nonic pint glass. 12/27/17 on bottom of can. A: Black body with 2-finger medium beige head with staying power but a little lackluster on the lacing. S: Delicious dark chocolate and medium caramel aromas with a little nutty note in there. I don't get much vanilla per se, but I think the intensity of the other aromas is heightened due to this addition. T: Flavor is a disappointment with a good blast of medium bittersweet chocolate with caramel sweetness but then it just heads to bitterness which seems off to me. The roast quality is too intense as well and does not work well with the above-average bitterness for the style. Alcohol presence is not heavy and there is no yeast character. M: Not as smooth as I was expecting due to the spiky bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation character due to the nitrogen. O: Decent beer but not a good value at all. I am not sure the imperial milk stout style works well but especially when the roast and bitterness is amped up like in this beer."
207,311190,Benish,"Poured from can. It instructed to ""shake gently"" and can still exploded when I opened it. Inverted the can while pouring and it formed a beautiful buckwheat pancake batter head. The beer is pitch black in color.Very rich aromas of milk chocolate and roasted malt but then it kind of cuts short. The tasting notes had very rich milk chocolate, almost brownie battered flavored with a rich sweet malt backbone. Just subtle hints of sweet vanilla at the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very dense. Overall I find the aroma and flavors just a little muted, thanks to the nitro. Also more expensive when compared to the Lefthand Milk Stout. Still good beer overall. It really doesn't taste like an 8% beer."
215,311190,metter98,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a finger high dense tan head that has the consistency of chocolate mousse. The head died down, but consistently left a short head covering the surface. S: Light aromas of dark malts and a bit of roast are present in the nose. T: The taste has flavors of dark and chocolate malts with a light amount of roast and hints of coffee beans. There is a light amount of bitterness. No alcohol is perceptible. The roasted flavors become stronger in the finish and linger through the aftertaste. M: It feels medium-bodied and silky smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer drinks like a Guinness because it hides its alcohol very well. I found the smooth mouthfeel to be the most enjoyable part of this beer. Serving type: nitro-can"
218,311190,Dragginballs76,Appearance - Pours jet black with huge creamy tan head as expected. Aroma - Not many aromas coming out some smoke and oak and a little chocolate. Taste - Dark bitter chocolate oak and some pretty heavy smoke no noticeable alcohol. Feel - Thick creamy and full bodied. pretty dry finish Overall - Not a huge fan of the bitter flavor.
231,367057,REVZEB,"Had on tap. Best dipa I have had in Ireland so far. Lovely pour with plenty of white foam, really allowing the bitter aromas from the hops comes out to play. The taste is a lovely dry citrus and hoppy dipa. The body could use a little more fullness, perhaps so more hop resin would help, but otherwise a lovely ale"
238,104824,KFBR392,"Batch #209 Appearance: On an aggressive pour, only a light ring of head formed on the edges of the glass. Pours deep dark brown and sits jet black in the glass. Light active carbonation. This beer looks like a huge, menacing barrel aged brew. Smell: The front of the nose is filled with potent bourbon and that familiar lactose sweetness found in many PW stouts. The barrel character carries throughout bringing oak, light smoke, and cherries on the body. The vanilla meshes so well with the bright alcohol sting. Lingering milk chocolate rounds out on the back end. Taste: Lactose sweetness filled with milk chocolate and vanilla hits the palate first. Barrel character warms up on the front of the body and continues to build slowly through, lingering long after drinking. Mossy oak meshes well in the body with the sweetness and chewy malt in this brew brings. Expected more barrel character after the aroma but more of the chocolate, vanilla, and lactose come through. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is an excellent middle ground, providing rich heavy malts but being light enough to allow the decadent flavors to shine through. Carbonation is very light which really gives this brew the feeling of a dessert beer. Overall: Extremely impressed with this. I love that the bourbon characteristics in this brew are so familiar to actually drinking Buffalo Trace. A definite alcohol sting with perfect accents of cherries and oak are all too familiar. I love a big barrel character which this brew brings yet the vanilla and chocolate tones come through very clearly as well. Awesome."
240,104824,sbxx,"Batch #209 12oz bottle poured into snifter Appearance - Pitch black, very little head, settles into a ring around the glass. Minimal lacing. Smell - Straight up bourbon & cocoa. Mostly bourbon. Taste - Meh. The barrel overwhelms the base beer. This tastes like Jones Dog with a shot of bourbon added to it. Mouthfeel - Medium body, medium carbonation, dry sticky finish. Overall - Glad the bottle was free! Just another mediocre, overpriced beer from these guys."
249,92616,pm5k00,"Drank on 6/6/18, but sticker from Total Wine (Temecula) says 11/20/17 ( So this IIPA is past its prime drinking age). Poured from a 22oz Bomber, pours light orange/dark yellow with minimal head. Descent carbonation. Aroma is faint, smells like a mix of Columbus and Nelson Sauvin. Aroma is probably faded due to age of beer. Taste is fine, mild sweetness with a low bitterness level for an IIPA ( I would guess 50 IBUs at this point) Pretty smooth overall, nothing spectacular, however due to its age it taste more like a blonde Barleywine, I would bet good money this IIPA taste vastly different fresh. Please keep in mind that this review is for a 7+ month old IIPA."
250,92616,DrinkThemAll,2016 On tap at the brewery. Nothing special here. Very watery and lacking any real flavors.
251,92616,TheRougeBastard,"22oz bomber picked up down Old Fort Rd from the brewery (Mrs. Bastard and her Sis weren't keen on joining me for an afternoon of debauchery). So here I sit at the ranch enjoying a few beverages. Faultline is true to the So. Cal D/IIPA script, nicely hopped with an above-average .abv! This would have a place in the D/IIPA rotation...to bad it's probably not distributed to NC!"
256,92616,Rick_Ereth,If you are a fan of IPAs then do NOT take my advice! Not my cup of tea - or should I say glass of beer!
257,92616,Dbenitez,"Good iPa, great taste and feel, good for starters"
263,92616,Nugganooch,"On tap at Aftershock – Temecula, CA Notes from 08/18/13 - 4oz taster A: Pure caramel color body with ample clarity and a thin topping of off white suds. Moderately low retention efforts that slip away to just a thin film hugging the edge of the glass. Some light dots and streak of stick remain after each sip. S: Smells real floral with a twist of tangerine and pine. There is a base of caramel malt sweetness emerging to round out the nose. Pleasant hoppy aromas with a nice botanic quality. T: Tastes of floral hops mixed with citrus zest and pine resin. A touch sweeter with some caramel malt presence and bit of toasted pale malts. There is a light tropical flare coming in. Moderate to higher level of bitterness to the beer and a bit of alcohol coming through in flavor. M: Moderate sized body with a nice smooth texture. Carb is a touch on the lower side but does not detract from the overall quality. Nice drying crisp on the finish. Touch of residual linger. D: A fair DIPA with some nice hoppy flavors made up of mostly floral and citrus. A touch on the sweeter side but with honest balance. Slightly unremarkable but nothing really flawed."
264,92616,DoubleJ,"On-tap at the source itself and served in an 8 ounce snifter. On to the beer: It's amber orange colored and given a tiny head on the pour, leaving a few whisps of lace. This Double IPA goes down the route of a juicy IPA rather than a grapefruit or pine bomb, giving off nice tropical flavors which aren't too intense. Its alcohol is hidden as well, a bonus. However, like the other two Aftershock beers which I samples, has little carbonation. Good as it stands, but with more bubbles has potential to get to the next level."
265,92616,Devinph,"I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what... The flavor was there, however there was no carbonation in the bottle. I know if this was carbonated it would be a great beer. I have a couple other bottles from them. Hopefully the stout will be better."
280,195387,Darkmagus82,"Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a deep orange amber color with a two finger head of fizzy white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of pumpkin pie aroma with a strong roasted pumpkin mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Along with these smells comes some aromas of a biscuit smell and a little bit of earthy smell. Taste – The taste begins with a rather crisp pumpkin flavor that has a decent sum of roast and spice of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice along with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel. As the taste moves forward the roast increases a bit with some other light hop flavors of earth and grass coming to the tongue as well. While up to this point there was almost no cream ale taste to the brew, toward the end, the cream really starts to kick it up; mixing with the roasted pumpkin nicely to create a rather pleasant, not too sweet, roasty but smooth pumpkin pie flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is rather thin with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. I would have liked a little more body and a bit less carbonation on this one, which would have complimented the roasted pumpkin flavors nicely. Overall though, it was a decent feel I suppose. Overall- This was a rather nice drinking, non-very sweet, modest abv. pumpkin ale. The touch of cream ale flavor at the end matches the pumpkin flavors nicely and creates a rather pleasant drinker."
284,125646,Choppin-Banana,"Nice color looking like dark pineapple juice, citrus aromas and sweet peach... nice mouth feel and very hoppy finish, slight aftertaste.... can taste the 8.2 but ever so slightly ... 2-3 might be max at one siting but still great offering"

Also notes of peach skin, passionfruit, mango & melon T- bright orange juice, grapefruit and citrus pith up front, followed by ripe peach, cantaloupe, mango and passionfruit. The finish is juicy and resinous with a hint of pine and pepper, lingers of more citrus juice M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a dry resinous finish O- juicy and drinkable, loaded with citrus and tropical fruity hops"
290,125646,Kcoondawg,"Hazy NE IPA golden color. Foamy head that quickly disappears. Juicy explosions at first pour. Smooth taste, little after taste, not too hoppy. Good mouth feel, some creaminess yet too much lingering feel. Overall great offering from TH, easy to drink everyday."
302,125646,mcsoupman,"What a good beer. Crisp clean taste of an IPA without the lingering aftertaste so common with IPAs. The beer felt ""full"" in the mouth without a syrupy or slimy texture. Smell was nice and pleasant with a lite hop/grain aroma."
305,125646,digboy,"Can dated 9/14/17 - about 6 weeks old, which may influence the review (i.e. hop flavor has faded a bit) Pours a very cloudy, vibrant orange-gold color with a 2 finger fluffy head that leaves nice lacing as it dies down. Aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine, not too strong but very present. As it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose. The taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop. The flavor has a little white pepper to it as well. The feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer. It is a little sticky on the lips as well. Clearly a great NEIPA. The tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well. There are many other NEIPAs I would be happier to have before this one but I wouldn't kick it out of bed by any measure."
311,92616,UCLABrewN84,"On tap at Aftershock Brewing Company in Temecula, CA. Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes."
312,92616,mactrail,"This pours a clear dark amber with an auburn cast. Not much of a head in the tall tulip glass, and below average carbonation in general. I am struggling to get much actual smell out of this, but it is powerfully hoppy-fruity in the nose and on the tongue. Rather sweet with a perfumey flavor along with the malt. Intense fruity hop flavor with some candy. Actually, it's really sweet. Dried pineapple and frozen apple juice concentrate. Some roasted malt along with all the caramel. With the right hops this could be an amber Barley Wine. Back of the throat scratchiness. A little woody and rather acidic with all the hops. Plenty of bitterness in the aftertaste. Here's yet another new brewery promising a full line of beers. They list 10 on tap already. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace on Point Loma Blvd. I wish they would lose the yellow wax dip, but that makes it ""special."""

326,58482,MaltyGoodness,"12oz. bottle Pours a clear amber color with a small tan head that maintains. Nice lacing on the glass. Sweet bready aroma packed with herbal hops. Very slightly sweet malty and bready flavor upfront. Leads into a bold amount of herbal hops with medium botterness. Finishes fairly clean with a slight lingering bitterness. Tastes very fresh. Medium body, well carbonated. Quite a nice Belgian pale ale. Done well to style and certainly quenched my thirst for just such a beer."
327,58482,SPRichard,picked up a single bottle 2 weeks back to try it out....finally got around to drinking it today copper/orange hue...cloudy body....thick white head...a little yeast floating around but it is a bottle conditioned beer so i expected some....nice strong presence of Belgian lacing down the glass floral hops with some citrus scents also...a touch of spiced yeast...fresh baked bread/biscuit Belgian funk...sweet bread....finishes with a mild earthy and pleasant floral hop very smooth carbonation bubbles that tickle the tongue a bit ...nice balance of hops and malt overall over the palate...medium bodied...slight traces of yeast spice and bitter hops on the palate glad i had a chance to give this one a shot...nothing like investing in a 4 or 6 pack of beer to find out you don't like it...i'll be sure to pick up a 4 pack of this on my next trip to the liquor store....always a plus to find a local made beer that is worth coming back too
328,58482,ChainGangGuy,"Snatched up a 4-pack of Zotten for $7.49 at Bullock's in Marietta, Georgia. I've typically enjoyed most of the Weyerbacher product I've had, so hopefully this'll hit a home run for me even if I'm not a sick, sick child dying in the hospital. Appearance: Pours out a dark, orange-amber body with a frothy, though somewhat short-lived, bone white head. Smell: Pale malts and light, crisp wheat malt brushed with a light, sweetish caramel sauce. Boldly spicy, zesty scent of fresh-ground pepper along with notes of Dubble Bubble bubblegum and citrus with some pine awakening upon warming. Taste: Pale malts and wheat coming across as a taste of particularly grainy whole wheat (but wholesome) bread. Light touch of sweet caramel glaze. Already there's a zip of peppery spiciness and flavor of bubblegum. Lesser hint of banana. Pinch of Florida orange citrus pith and a few drop of pine resin with a medium-plus amount of hop bitterness. A bit of watercress late in the taste. Dry, earthy, spicy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Drinkability: Why, that's generally likable! Plenty of flavors and complexity to keep me fairly well-entertained, but, thankfully, it's easy-going on the overall ABV. I do look forward the three remaining bottles!"
329,58482,mikey711,"Poured into an oversized wine glass. A bit darker than I expected as it was amber in tint with a thick head that disappeared quickly. It smells very earthy, but still has that bubblegummy sweetness in the nose as well. Also a touch of hop spice. I think i was hoping for a bit more sourness, but this was a good effort. It is earthy and and full of esters. The mouth feel is pretty consistant with th style but it isn't going to replace any imports in this style. Also, there is a bit of a soapiness which was a bit off putting."
330,58482,jwc215,"Poured into tulip glass: Pours golden amber with a thin white head that slowly becomes a patch. Some lacing sticks. Nice color, but doesn't have the head retention or lacing that I would expect. THe smell is of a sweet fruitiness and grainy with some yeasty notes. Slight tart notes are mixed in from the fruitiness. The taste is sweet and fruity - hint of bubblegum - that quickly turns to a dry, herbal finish. It it light-bodied. A few more effervescent bubbles would make it more lively, IMO. This is sweet and fruity/grainy turning (almost too quickly) to herbal (aspirin-y) dry. It has a certain character that gives it the ""American attempt at Belgian"". It's fine, for that."
331,58482,GeoffFromSJ,"This beer caught me off-guard in how good it was. A pleasant mix of Brett funk and hops. Brett on the nose. The taste is well constructed. Brett up-front. And then a pleasant and non-overwhelming hops bitterness at the end. I highly recommend this, especially for any Orval fans out there."
334,58482,WVbeergeek,"Appears a beautifully clouded copper orange hue with a thick chunky doughnut like cream tinted white head, has some yeast specks floating on board. Lacing is perfect fine Belgian style lacing evenly strong around my glass. Aromatics offer up floral hops with citrus components joining in, mildly spiced yeast notes with fresh baked bread in the biscuit malt department. Very soothing and delicious smelling brew from Weyerbacher. A superb blend of flavors collide with cookie dough like malt and sweet bread layers with yeast spicing the party up a bit. Finishing with mildly earthy, pungently citric, and pleasantly floral hop additions. A bit of undeniable Belgian funk going down brings it all together. A perfect blend of spiced bready hoppy ale sits in my glass very well done the most finesse to come of Dan Weirback in some time. Mouthfeel is so smooth carbonation bubbles to tickle a bit but overall the balance of malt and hops streaks so nicely across the palate, quite the interesting medium bodied Belgian style pale. Leaves traces of yeast spice and bittering hops on the palate, and hop burps will follow and tickle the nose. Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist."
335,58482,OldSchoolGamer,"I haven't had a lot of Belgain Pale Ales. I think the last one I had was Leffe Blonde, which I hated. Lets see if Weyerbacher can cange my perception of the style: A: Pours a nice golden straw color. Head is a bright white color, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is very minimal. S: Lots of Belgian yeast. Some fruityness. I also get a touch of hops. T: Pretty solid Belgian Pale Ale. First thing you get is the Belgian yeast. There is also some spice in there. Then there is a almost melon-like fruityness. The finish is grassy hops. Not bad. M: Medium to light bodied. Pretty carbonated mouthfeel. Very smooth. D: Decent flavors and mouthfeel. However, I think this is a one and done type of beer. Drinks easily, but not something I could drink a lot of. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The Belgian character is there, but there is also a unique fruit and hop character that adds to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. Definetly worth a shot, even if you are not a Belgian Ale fan. Recommended."
336,58482,magnj,"a - Somewhat hazy orange body sits below a generous film that developed after an initial 2 finger fluffly white head. s - Spicy Belgian yeast, way more up front than I was expecting, then again I don't know what exactly I was expecting. Inviting and sweet, missing the hops I was expecting but I assume that will come in the taste. t - Delicate hops flavor overshadowed by spicy Belgian yeasties. I was expecting a hop bomb from Weyerbacher but this is not it. That being said, this is a tasty brew. Sweet but not overdone, finishes clean and dry but the complex yeast flavors linger for a while. m/d - Nice and light though still a bit sweet like it's big Belgian Triple brothers. Much more refreshing but I'm still wary, I'm used to this taste having a sneaky alcohol punch to it in the end. Really drinkable, complex and a fun style I have not had much experience with."
337,58482,NiceGuyMike,"Dark clear golden hue with a lovely white, fluffy head with almost no lacing. This brew does not have strong smells, but there are some light fruity Belgian fruity sents with rather strong smell of of alcohol. First taste is a generic American Belgian flavor with spicy pepper and bitterness (a bit much too) to follow. A wonderful Bready flavor follows the spice. Oddly the alcohol flavors are well controled. Medium body with some nice effervecance which highlights the pepperiness. I like the breadyness of this beer."
338,58482,fav920,"Not a pro with belgian pale ales, but i like this a lot. If you've had Quad by Weyerbacher (which I love), this tastes like a ""Quad Light"". I will buy this again, and paid $7.75 for a 4pk at Jonathon Ron in Brielle, NJ. Another quality beer by Weyerbacher!"
339,58482,roan22,"Had this on draft at the Devils Den. appearance: nice golden color, very fresh aroma: belgian yeast, fruity sweetness taste: overly sweet, seems like it should be dryer. sweet belgian taste dominates..I do note hops too but they aren't bitter enough to cut the sweetness for me. kind of banana in the finish which turns me off. mouthfeel is alright, except the banana taste! drinkability: no, I'll pass. too sweet for me."
340,58482,BirdFlu,"Pours a copper-amber color with foamy off-white head. I was expecting it to be cloudier for some reason, nice head, though. Aroma is bready, citrusy with lemon zest and orange peel, a bit yeasty and certainly tons of banana and clove. So kind of typical. for your spiceir belgian pales.. Taste is pretty much same as aromas, yeasty, spicery with black pepper, etc. I would like it a bit sweeter. Mouth is moderate, fairly spicey with a peppery aftertaste/feel in the back of the throat. Overall its lighter in body and sessionable in that sense. The flavor is a bit off, though, and the spice is a bit much. I would enjoy it more with a bit more sweetness."
341,58482,BigMike,Pours a cloudy yellow with pale white fizzy head. Smell is very yeasty and grainy. Some citrus and hops and a touch of floral. Taste is the same. Lot's and lot's of yeasty sweetness. A touch of grapefruit and a slight hoppy finish. Thin mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated. Easy to drink. The thing that gets me about this ine is that it's a session beer that comes in a 4-pack. Good summer brew though. Probably not one i will try again. Not that theres anything wrong with it. This just isn't my favorite style.
342,58482,corby112,"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with thin foam white head that quickly settles into thin ring that leaves minimal lacing. Crisp light fruit aroma with subtle hops and apple, pear and citrus notes. There's also some nice citrus/lemon zest and peppery spice in the nose. Earthy hop flavor balances out light crisp fruit notes. Hints of apple, citrus peel, lemon zest and other peppery spices. Medium bodied that is smooth and easy drinking with a slightly tart, dry finish."
343,64319,metter98,"On-tap at Venice Ale House, Venice, CA A: The beer is clear dark golden yellow in color and has a moderate amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a thin white head that left a large patch of bubbles in the center and a collar around the edge of the glass. S: Light to moderate aromas of nondescript malts are present in the nose. T: The taste is similar to the smell and has flavors of light malts along with slight hints of sweetness. M: It feels just about medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. O: This beer seems a lot more like an American Blonde Ale than a Belgian Pale Ale. I didn't get any bits of Belgian yeast in the smell or taste."
346,58482,ColForbinBC,"12oz bottle poured in a tulip A rather deep orange body with a good amount of clarity and visible carbonation. A thick, slightly off-white cap rises and falls quickly. A small amount of sticky lace is left on the glass. A hearty Belgian yeast aroma, ripe fruits, with an herbal, medicinal hop profile and a solid bready malt. Raisins and bananas are the primary fruit. An astringent, medicinal hop profile really cuts through all of the other flavors and took me a sip or two to adjust. A signature Belgian yeast flavor of banana and an adequate amount of spice blend in with the aforementioned astringent hops and orange rind. The finish is a strong, bready malt flavor, think raisin bread. A very creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation. They nearly nailed this one. Finish is dry and bready with just a touch of bitterness. A pretty sessionable offering, easily drinkable. Would like to see it in six packs rather than four packs. A solid addition to the weyerbacher lineup. I will definitely be buying this again."
347,58482,drcarver,"A - a cloudy, medium amber color with a small 1/2 finger white head that lasts. S - hint of perfume, citrus, and spice A - a strong flavor of banana and pear balanced with citrus and a clove like spice. A long-hanging aftertaste M - Smooth and creamy D - Goes down nicely."
348,58482,vikingloki,"On tap at the Bear Creek Grille in Macungie. I'm a Weyerbacher fan, I admire and them and usually love their big beers. Comes to the table in a frosty pint glass, almost a reddish color with not much of a head, probably lost in the trip to the table. i like the color, it's a ""light foxy red"". Smells good, interesting, yeasty, bready, hoppy, complex. Taste is not what I expect - there is a very unusual, but I wouldn't say bad, kind of 'zing' thru-out, my guess is it's the yeast. Beer finishes dry with a little hop smack at the end like an afterthought. The yeasty taste lingers on the palate and to my dismay does not compliment the beer cheese dip and beer bread. I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I'd like to give it another chance sometime. Maybe having one that's been bottled in a month might mellow out that oddish tase."
349,58482,Hojaminbag,"A hazy, pale, golden body with about one and a half fingers of off white head that sticks around for awhile, but doesn't really leave any lacing behind. The nose is fruity and a little spicy. There is a nice fruit flavor in there that I cannot really pinpoint as a single fruit: just take my word for it that it is fruit. Next there is a slight peppert flavor, and maybe a touch of ansie-like flavor. There is just a touch of bready flavors from the malt. Mostly a yeast driven beer, and pretty good. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick and full. Pretty drinkable beer. I think I saw some cases for less than 40 bucks; I might go pick one up."
350,58482,tempest,"On-tap for $5 a pint at Liberty St. Tavern in Allentown. Appeared a hazy amber with a short head. This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool. This beer needs some work, but it's not a good beer yet."
351,58482,woodychandler,"An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike."
352,58482,Birdiebeagle,Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body. A resiny texture. The finish is good with a quality aftertaste. I love these guys beers.
353,58482,ejimhof,"About 7 0r 8 years ago I bought the Weyerbacher sampler case and sad to say I found it hard to finish. I swore I would not spend any more money on their products. Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan. And I am buying their beer again."
354,58482,JoePetto,"On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a ""tweener"" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session."
355,58482,NJpadreFan,"Weyerbacher- Zotten A- Hazy cloudy orange/brown with a huge thick frothy head. S- Spicy. Orange peel, grape, and cherry. T- Spicy dry cloves with a tart fruity bite. Cherry, orange, lemon, and grape really come out. Wheaty and yeasty. M- Very dry and spicy. A harsh bitter aftertaste. Overall- Good spiciness. Slight metallic bitterness is a bit bothersome."
360,64319,MV_CHI-NS,"Appearance: Light gamboge/jonquil body with an isabelline head. Aroma: Bitter malts, grains, and rather yeasty. Taste: 'Light hops and dirty earth' were the first things that came to mind when drinking this; it reminded me of Old Style. Mouthfeel: Considerably light carbonation - rather flat, actually. Overall: Certainly not one of the best beers I have had, let alone one of the best blondes I have had. I had this along with Brouwerij West's 'Tripel' and was excited as it was my first time trying their beers. I don't think I will be revisiting this one."
366,64319,beertunes,"16.9oz bottle poured into straight pint glass. Poured a hazy yellow color with over 3/4 inch of white head that decent retention and moderate lacing. The aroma featured a good grain base, had a bright yeast scent, and had a bit of spiciness floating around. The flavors followed the scents pretty closely, grain, spice, and yeast, it was a pretty typical flavor profile for the style. The body was smooth and even, with a clean finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smoothly and quickly. Overall, a nice little beer, but nothing special. Worth grabbing if you see a nice price on it."
367,64319,mhaugo,"500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Appearance: Light butterscotch, thin white head, as cloudy as grandma’s cataract. Smell: I swear to god this smells like a skunked Corona. It’s that bottle that’s been sitting on the shelf at 7-11 for who knows how long and could not have possibly absorbed more light. Mutated, spicy noble hops. Terrible. Taste: Also tastes like bad Corona. Bad Corona that someone ran through a grain bed of pilsner malt and wheat. I almost could not finish it. Mouthfeel: Light body, medium carbonation. Overall: This brewery could not possibly ask more of me as a consumer. I heard about what they’re doing, went out and purchased a bottle of each, and will probably never buy anything else they make. I’ve been underwhelmed five times in a row. This beer may be the worst of them. I absolutely love the artwork on their labels, and the fact that they intend to rotate them, but I guess I’ll be appreciating them on the shelf going forward."
369,64319,mactrail,"A light and spritzy brew with a distinct Belgian edge. Pale hazy golden in the glass with a modest foam and adequate spritzy mouthfeel. This tastes a lot like the Swing Session Saison from Victory that I tried last night, though a little more robust. Still this is pale and light bodied with yeasty funk and more of a Brettanomyces flavor. A pleasant beery smell. Very bitter with the yeasty flavors, lasting long into the aftertaste. Quite drinkable and not overpriced. But very dry and hard edged. No trace of fruit or mellow malt in this one. Eventually this just pushes to the bitter end and I can't finish a bottle of this stuff, in spite of its virtues. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego for $5.15."
370,64319,RblWthACoz,"Pours a clouded yellow gold with a decently thick white-ish head. Nice Belgian profile on this. It's been aging for at least 8 or 9 months, I think, so it seems somewhat mellow. Tones of lemon, though not obnoxiously so. Mild yeast and bread are also there. A nice easy drinker. Not too bad, and better than I seem to recall from the last time I tried this beer."
373,64319,kojevergas,"16.9 fluid oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap acquired at Cap N Cork liquor in Los Feliz and served into a Uinta pilsner glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Cost was $5.99. Expectations are above average; I dig the marketing. Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: Pours a three finger beige colour head of nice cream and thickness, and good retention - thought the ABV is merely 5.50%. Body colour is a pale yellow. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Transparent. Nonopaque. Sm: Fresh clean pale malts. Lemongrass. Lemon zest. Citrus zest. A clean appealing aroma for the style. Little yeast. No alcohol is detectable. An average strength aroma. A bit adulterated. Artificial floral notes. Artificial lime. A bit reminiscent of a crappy Spanish lager. T/Mf: Artificial crappy lime up front immediately. A clean malt and decent zesty lemon body. Comes off artificial and a bit syrupy. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Very strange for the style. A bit garbage. I don't care much for it. It's certainly not well balanced. Overly malty. Poorly built for the style. Dr: Drinkable but underwhelming and overpriced. Very forgettable. Beneath pedestrian. Why brew this? I don't look forward to trying this brewery's other beers. D"
375,64319,UCLABrewN84,"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a 1 inch foamy tan head that fades to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight skunk which is weird because the bottle is brown. The smell reminds me more of a foreign lager than a Belgian style pale ale. Fortunately, the taste is much better with malt, grain, yeast, and some spice flavors on the finish. I am also picking up some grassy and herbal flavors as the beer warms up a bit. There is a medium spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that walks an interesting balance of having a mediocre smell but a great taste."
376,64319,Wowcoolman,"Sampled on tap at Whole Foods with Brian Mercer, the creative force behind Brouwerij West. Pours a yellow-gold color with some head retention. The nose is a tad funky with some lemony esters joining in. The taste is refreshing with a dry, straw-like character and a slight phenolic finish. Brain is devoted to recreating Belgian flavors and I would not think this was a West Coast beer. The mouthfeel is ample and creamy. Quite enjoyable if you enjoy old world styles."
380,64319,womencantsail,"On-tap at Provisions A: The pour on this one is a clear, pale straw color with a small white head. S: An almost popcorn-like aroma with a decent amount of bread. A strong grass and floral perfume aroma along with a touch of melon. Fairly light yeast, phenols, and esters. T: Decently sweet with a fair amount of bread. A bit of citrus peel and spice on the middle of the palate. Lightly grassy with some perfume character and floral notes. M: The body is fairly light with a medium level of carbonation. O: A decent light Belgian beer, but not really my favorite."
389,64319,jminsc76,"On tap presently at The Library in Santa Monica. Pours a white frothy head atop a yellow, golden body. A highly effervescent look with pretty bubbles rising and dancing upon agitation. The bouquet is highly floral, with strong wheat aromas and mild lavender. More or less it's like smelling a White Orchard from The Bruery, though slightly less floral, with more wheat and yeast. Flavors are yeasty, much like the aromas, much like White Orchard, though smoother and with substantial meat behind it. It’s almost as if I am chewing on the wheat, with a highly complex, smooth, dry heartiness that makes it so pleasant. Which leads me to the… …mouthfeel, which is dry and ebullient upon swishing, and very clean. Overall, this is damn good, maintaining high drinkability both from its flavors, mouthfeel, and excellent crispness. Ideal for pairing with food (thinking a good salad with some goat cheese or a fish dish) as well as a standalone sipping aperitif. Easily could I throw back two or three per sitting."
390,64319,DoubleJ,"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, on to the beer: Pale yellow in color with little head retention on top. The aroma is difficult to make out; it smells most like a barnyard. A little sulfur make way. I thought the funk would lighten up from there, but it keeps going strong into the taste. From the taste, I could close my eyes and pretend I was on a farm. In fact, it seems to resemble a saison better than a Belgian Blond. At some points it's pushing itself to being uncomfortable, though I find a way enjoy it. This is definately not for the faint of heart."
391,64319,beagle75,"Draft service into a long-stemmed fluted tulip glass at Beachwood BBQ. A: Slightly hazy, medium golden color with one finger of fine white foam head. No lacing remains on the glass, although a few submerged and clustered bubbles cling to the side. S: Toasted grain and clean but characterful Belgian yeast present a smell that is slightly spicy and herbaceous, but otherwise clean. T: Begins almost dry, with bright fruit consisting of pear and golden raisin alongside estery farmhouse yeast. Acidity is managed well, remaining restrained but lively. Delicate pale malt emerges in the middle as flavors of malt and yeast turn bready. The finish is mild and yeasty, seeing a tasteful and palate-cleansing resurgence of acidity. M: Thin to medium viscosity, refreshing on the palate, early acidity is not quite felt, with moderate carbonation. D/O: This is an unassuming beer of ordinary strength and intensity that delivers Belgian-style character in exactly the expected quantity. Comparable to Russian River Redemption, it lacks the extreme dryness and blanketing wheat-like quality of that other beer. It is a bit limp to look at, in a way that Russian River beers almost never are, but otherwise it makes for a worthy saison/single cross-over."
404,104824,emerge077,"Black with brownish edges, thin layer of tan foam across the surface that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges of the glass. Very minimal if any spotty lace. Aroma is sweet and boozy, later becoming a little more earthy and woody at room temperature. Initially it's like sniffing a pour of Buffalo Trace. Taste has more nuance, though still plenty of whiskey heat packed in. Woody drying aftertaste, much like a sip of bourbon. Middle has notes of earthy roasted malt, toffee, caramel, toasted almond, dry tobacco leaves. Chewy and rich, but not without some sting and numbing alcohol. Overall a little more balance would be nice, though it tastes good."
406,104824,homebrew311,"Pours a deep opaque black with nearly no head. The nose is spirit forward with huge oak and char notes paired with strong vanilla. Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon."
416,104824,langchops,"Bottle poured into HF glass Batch 209 A - Pours a deep brown, like partly used motor oil. Head quickly dissipates, very little lacing. As expected S - Smells of sweet vanilla with a hint of chocolate, but vanilla is more pronounced T- Follows the nose but the smooth bourbon notes are just amazing. A little closed straight from the cellar, but after an hour, this opens up very nicely. The vanilla, choclate and alcohol notes are well balanced at this point. Can't find much wrong here M - Fairly thick and coating, O - A very good version of this beer. Also had this at Fobab and it's even better than I remember. Please let this one warm up, its worth it"
417,178980,ajm5108,"Got this at a local pub in PA across the state lind from the brewery. Couldn't find any info on the thirsty dog website about the beer, but it isn't their advertised as their normal berliner. The bar is a legit craft haven in the area so I trust it wasn't a mistake. It had a dry hay and orange peel nose, the tart is gentle but noticeable with the citrus carrying through. The big thing is that it is very creamy and velvety feel, with a vanilla orangcicle flavor, which I assume comes from the barrel aging. Have not had the regular Berliner from them so nothing to compare it to, but this version was excellent"
422,203086,champ103,"On tap at the brewery A: Pours a hazed, cloudy golden/orange color. A minimal white head forms, and recedes quickly with very spotty lace. S: Pine, soapy, grapefruit rind, light citrus. Pale malts, that do little to balance, but can be picked out. Finishes with soapy, resinous, piny hops. T: Like the nose, piny and soapy hops dominate. Slick and oily. Very light malts. Finishes on the bitter grapefruit, pine side of the spectrum. Still fairly mundane. M/O: A medium body. It is almost impressive that this is not watery and thin. Not crisp carbonation, but a bit higher than some of the other offerings. Oily and resinous. Given the mundane character, not bad to sip on. A slight step up from the other beers I had. Though a fairly non impressive DIPA."
423,47792,WillieMoe,"One of the current cask conditioned brews available at the Canal St. Beer Works. Nice golden yellow look to it with a thin head, mildly hazy. Has a nice spiced fruit aroma to it, with the camomille sticking out, but also some coriander and decent floral notes. Has a solid citrusy taste about it, with the hop taste being fairly understated, mixing well with the spices. Has a nice full body and a solid bitterness. A nice solid brew, that is definitely worth a try."
424,47792,IBUnit63,"Into a pint glass we go. This pours much like a Belgian pale...1 1/2-finger head with solid lacing. Body is very light lemon-honey and with a little bit of cloud cover. Of course this is extremely floral, fruity and calming. The chamomile is definitely the master of this domain. There's a fair amount of tropical (and other) fruits here - cantaloupe, a bit of pear, too...and a little papaya? The hop bitterness can best be described as Saaz-ish...tight and a little piney. The chamomile has that nighttime herbal tea quality to it - it's pretty hardcore in a cask. I wonder if the chamomile lends itself better to a regular cold tap - it gets a little thick after a while. Palate feel is very sweet and tight, with a heavy wallop of bitterness from the chamomile husks. Pretty hefty. Yup - this is OK but I think in a regular tap it would do better - chamomile on cask is a little over the top. Interesting pour though."
427,288531,WoodBrew,I'm trying this at the brewery. It poured a clear golden with white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent was mild...subtle presence of citrus peel. The taste was bitter leaning with sweet malt presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it's ok.
440,209991,Moose90,"Served On-Tap A - Pours a deep dark ruby tinged black color into the glass. There is a billowy coffee brown colored head formed on top that leaves behind some quality lacing. S - Smell is bitter roasted and toasted, chewy dark malts intermingled with hints of coffee and chocolate. T - Taste is rich and robust without being sweet. Notes of bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and a light dark fruit note. M - Medium-Full bodied, rich and satisfying. O - Good overall, classic American Stout."
441,106164,aussiebeer,Nothing negative about this one
449,106164,mfnmbvp,"22 oz. bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. Handwritten Batch #75 on the label. My third beer from Chicago's Spiteful Brewing. Poured into a clear balloon snifter. A - Pours a finger and a half of soft fluffy soapy khaki head on top of a bright burnt sienna orange colored body with some ruby red highlights when held to the light. Scattered lacing. Looks very nice. S - Smell is of bright juicy floral & tropical hops, grass, some cream, some soapiness, red / amber malt, caramel, faint molasses / brown sugar, and a hint of alcohol. T - Taste is of big bitter grapefruit hops, peppery rye, caramel / amber malt, some brown sugar sweetness, and some dirty herbal earthiness. M - Feel goes down smooth and clean, with some herbal grapefruit hop bitterness clinging to the palate. Medium full body with good carbonation. Overall, another nice beer from Spiteful Brewing. These guys haven't let me down yet, and by the looks of things, it seems like I'm going to have to try some more of their beers. These local Chicago breweries have really been doing great things lately. Spiteful Brewing Negative Nancy ---4/5."
450,106164,bpgpitt10,"A: Great red color. Served with a nice two finger white head that leaves lacing and is downright thick. Not sure what else I could ask for. S: Malt with some spice to it. Citrus that is totally on the lemon side rather than orange/grapefruit/mango. T: Mild sweetness that is balanced with the lemon coming through on the palate. Really low overall residual bitterness. The more I drink it, the more the bitter hangs around a little. It's not overpowering at all though. Light alcohol burn at the end... not necessarily bad though. M: Medium. Maybe a little on the light side. Nothing to write home about. O: Solid beer that I'd have another one of. It doesn't do anything amazing, but it's a solid offering and worth a try."
458,84394,drabmuh,"Served on draft at CK, served in a snifter, reviewed from notes. This beer is odd to put it politely, to be less polite, it spent enough time in the barrel to remove any interesting hop character but not long enough to pick up a lot of barrel character, the resulting beer is a dull bland shadow of an IPA that I completely don't understand as a beer. Beer is orangish with a mild haze and some wispy head, mostly clear, looks like beer. Aroma is mildly oaky, some whiskey / booze. Beer is light in body and finishes a little dry with minimal bitterness and some liquor / alcohol / oakiness up front. There is no tannic character to the beer and the overall is just a disappointment. Maybe I just don't like barrel aged IPAs but I have yet to have one that I thought, ""Yeah, this did improve the beer."" IPAs are one of those beers that is close to impossible to improve through the exposure to time, oxygen, and wood. Not saying it cannot be done but this is yet another example in a growing postulate of mine that this is not likely to yield good results. Not a repeat for me."
460,84394,kylehay2004,"Single finger head on a clear deep golden body. Some lacing. Mild hops, mostly citrus and metallic notes with oak on the nose. The flavor is interesting with the oak mixing with earthy and metallic hops making a very herbal flavor. Sounds confusing but that's how this beer went. Medium body ad moderate carbonation. Never had a sessioned IPA barrel aged. Unique making it a must try. I am guessing te ABV listed for this one was off a bit but it was advertised at 4.5."
466,125646,VoxRationis,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; produced on 10/25/2017 -- three days ago. A: Pours a very cloudy, bright, light orange color with a one inch head, good retention, and robust lacing. S: The fragrance reaches out to the nose from a distance while decanting. Aromas of mango, orange, pineapple, and peach predominate. Pepper/pine/spice notes. T: Largely follows the nose with flavors of peach and orange dominant. Bitterness kicks in slowly, leading to a refreshing finish. M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Creamy and smooth. O: This is really a great New England style DIPA, honestly the best that I have had. Certainly worth a trip to the brewery."
470,125646,HankSingle,"Goodness, me. A gift from a friend, just back from Western MA. I thought it looked a little light - a beautiful, bright, luminous light orange, hazy as the name suggests, but it seemed pale for the stats. Everything else, though. Ripping fruits on the nose, this drinks like the most perfectly balanced mimosa - fresh squeezed orange juice and kinetic effervescence...it's impossible to connect this beer with its alcohol content until after you've finished it, it is just so light, and so lovely. Soft and creamy on the tongue, it leaves the exactly perfect trail of crisp bitterness on the release. I loved this beer, very close to the best one I've ever had, I think. I was shattered when it was gone."
472,125646,Holderness,"Canned 12 days ago. L — See: Name S — Orange, cream, chalky yeastiness, mango, guava, and, interestingly, a touch of spirulina/chlorella T — Peach and orange dominate the palate. Reminds me more of Julius than Green, but has less of that orange creamsicle quality. Also getting pineapple, papaya, mango, and white bready malts F — Smooth, gently creamy, fluffy texture. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Immensely smooth and drinkable for the ABV. Practically no bitterness, save for a slight tea-like quality between sip and finish. Semi-sweet O — Even though it doesn’t quite top the perfection that is Julius/Green, this is still my favorite DIPA to date. I simply cannot believe that this is 8.2% ABV. Drinking blind, I would guess 5.5% 94/100 EDIT(9/13/18): 2-week-old can. Reaffirming all above notes. It is so hard to not chug this. Straight peach juice"
473,125646,bubseymour,Do you really need another review? What’s not to like here?
479,125646,yasky,"Near opaque light orange pour, dare i say hazy, thumb sized head, good retention, lacing. Aroma of melon, orange, peach. Orange juice up front, very light dankness, pineapple, canteloupe, peach. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel, perfect for this type of beer. Damn."
486,63496,Onenote81,"Stopped in here with the family for lunch before we headed to Pilot Mt State Park. I've been here in the past and they haven't had any beer at the time. Used to just have 2 offerings. They now have 4, all of which were on tap. I ordered this one as I am a sucker for IPAs. The bartendress wasn't sure if this was an American or English style. I labelled it American from the hop profile. Came out a very dark rusty copper color with a thin white head on it. Little retention, but there were many pretty sip rings left after each sip. The nose was pretty basic with some floral tones and a sharp hoppy scent. Decent body on this one. Moderate carbonation. Good depth. Wonderful bitter hops all over this one. Some faint orange sweetness, grass, and more hops. This one is a hop-head beer for sure. Wasn't sure what to expect from this little place, but if this is any indication of what the rest of their lineup is like, I'll be back to try the rest. Good beer."
487,58482,Gavage,"Appearance: orange in color with some yellow highlights. A one finger head lingers around a while. Smell: bread and a spicy yeast aroma is very pleasant on the nose. Taste: bready caramel base with a very spicy yeast flavor that comes through quite strongly. Bitterness is a bit mild, and there is a soft fruit sweetness in the background. Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. Medium bodied. Aftertaste is long as the yeast spiciness lingers in the mouth. Drinkability: this beer went down quite easily and after the second glass, I could have had another. Nice new addition to the regular lineup."
488,58482,ATPete,"12oz bottle Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Lots of banana in the aroma right from the get go, bready yeast, clovey wheat beer like spice and a mild dosage of hops. Good flavor, definitely Belgian inspired, i like the serious malt structure here, bready again with just enough sweetness to match. IMO this beer needs more hops, i know they are going for a balanced Belgian/American Pale Ale here but a little added bitterness and crispness from another peppering of hops wouldnt hurt this beer any. None the less another solid offering from Weyerbacher and one im glad to have year round. The artwork and package design is great as well, i think this is the visual direction Weyerbacher needs to take in order to put their beer in more peoples hands."
489,58482,yen157,"Honey orange with yellow flashes. Not much head, though a creamy collar remains. Bright, lively nose with big banana, clove phenol, and breadiness reminiscent of raw pizza dough. Flavors follow in lockstep with the nose except that it is punctuated by a pleasant tart yeast character and balanced by mineral water and New World hoppiness, all in bittering and flavor as well as some bubblegum late into the finish. I made the mistake drinking this out of the fridge too cold. Breadiness came out as it warmed. Overall, very good. It does a great job filling the niche of something interesting and sessionable that's not a lager or basic pale."
490,58482,tpd975,"A: Pours a slightly cloudy deep piss yellow hue. The head was huge at least 4 fingers in height. The retention was just as ridiculous. Tons of extra thick foam clings to the glass to form 3D lacing. S: Nice light belgian aromas. Light banana with subtle hints of spice. Yeast dominates, but there are nice bready notes as well. T: Very similar to aroma but a bit more bold. Nice Banana like Belgian yeast. Bread, with notes of pepper and clove. M: Medium in body, pretty smooth with great carbonation....almost too much. D: Not bad, the folks in Belgium won't be doing back flips over this one, but it is pretty tasty nonetheless."
491,58482,mikereaser,"A - pours a murky orange color with 1/4 inch of foam S - not a whole of aroma, some bananas, floral hops T - again, bananas, bready flavor, with a little bit of floral hop M/D - really dry finish, but nice carbonation. A bit tart to me, not my favorite."
492,58482,akorsak,"A 12 oz bottle from the Riserva release last summer. A: The ale is a brilliant, bright golden color, crystal clear save for the stream of bubbles in the center of the glass. A half a finger of head almost spilled out over the glass. S: The aroma is strong, even from an arm's length the Belgian scents are strong. Candi sugars, pepper and dry fruity yeast are all strong. T: Wow! This ale is intensely dry. The yeast strain has done its job and stripped all of the sugars out of this beer. Pepper is strong, tempering the ale with a pleasant heat. The remnants of candi sugar swirl around near the end of each sip. Pale grains add a caramel flavor and a nice dose of citrusy hops is not too strong. The ale is very similar to Orval, save for the lack of brett. M: The mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and sharp with a constant stream of carbonation to keep things jumping. D: A nice one-off offering that, at least for me, got lost behind Thirteen and Riserva."
493,58482,SaCkErZ9,"Thanks to Risser09 for this one. Pours from a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. SLightly cloudy golden orange color with a stiff and tall white head. Rocky, dense, and massive. Tons of lacing and the head lasts for the duration of consumption. Aroma is slightly subdued. Certainly some belgian sugars, a touch of yeast. Slight earthy hop aroma. Perhaps some spicy corriander or black pepper. Sweet upfront with a sweet hop bite in the back. Belgian sugars. Ends with a different, sweet fruitiness typical in a Tripel. Distinct hop bite in the finish. Finishes really dry and crisp. Somewhat oily as well. I actually enjoyed this one. Seems like it may be an American interpretation as the hops seem to be non tradtional and more citrusy (read: west coast USA). I really liked this, alot. Thanks again to Risser09 for this one."
494,58482,orbitalr0x,"12oz bottle. Excited to give this a try. Pours into my glass a hazy yellow orange with a billowing bubbly white head on top. Lots of active carbonation. Aromas start out with sweet pale grain malts along with some banana and spice with a bold clove accent. Belgian yeast as well. Rather mellow. First sip brings a crisp light grain malt upfront that carries with it some sweetness. Some banana and fruit accents follow along with a spiciness of clove and light pepper. Finishes with a touch of Belgian yeast and lingering sweetness. Overall it is just not cohesive and ends up being rather bland. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an onslaught of fast moving carbonation. The excess carbonation gets in the way and knocks down my enjoyment of the brew. Overall, I'm really not digging this brew. It falls somewhat flat flavor wise and ends up being rather boring. Thanks to afterexile for the opportunity to try it."
495,58482,PittBeerGirl,A- This is a beautiful Belgian Pale. Body is a cloudy pale yellow that is served with a 1-2 finger white foamy head. The head eventually settles down to &lt;1/2 finger and retains this well. Cloudiness is thick and uniform. S- Lots of banana and floral hops come to the nose. Thats about all I was able to gather. T- This is pretty heavy on banana (for the style) upfront. A very perfume-like funky flavor is also present that I can't put my finger on. This all has a moderate yeast backbone and spices added. A little bit of floral hop bitterness comes through for the finish and not much lingers on. M- Weyerbacher did a great job with the mouthfeel. Low-Medium carbonation with a smooth yeasty body. D- This is a decent Pale Ale that is pretty easy to drink. Its strength is definitely the mouthfeel. Definitely not my favorite of the style but a decent example.
504,58482,Gueuzedude,"Quite aromatic smelling as I pour this beer; I get layers of fruit and vibrant spice. A soft pour yields a four-finger thick, light tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is a bright, amber color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, copper color when held up to the light. Aromas of ripe pears, sweet plums and aromatic apples mix with spice notes of big clove and light pepper. Towards the finish some notes of thin, fermented grape juice aromas start to come through; a touch tart, almost cider like and with a mineral, almost metallic edge. A touch of dusty malt towards the finish helps to round things out a bit. An interesting aroma that accentuates fruit and lots of clove. Lightly sweet with a mix of apple and some huge, phenolic driven clove flavors up front. The beer is quite well carbonated, which contributes to a definite fizzy texture as it flows across the tongue. The finish has quite a bit of sharp phenolic notes to it, leaning towards clove but with a touch of a harsher edge and something a bit like cola. Underneath the omnipresent phenolics is a touch of fresh grain character, some soft fruity esters (that the clove notes seem to make cidery at times) and some spicy higher alcohols. Pretty light bodied, though not thin, the carbonation definitely helps with the perceived lightness as well. Definitely characterful for a Belgian Pale Ale. It can be a bit too phenolic at times as the Clove character is a bit dominating. Not bad though."
505,58482,OWSLEY069,"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a off white head. In the aroma, candy sugar, and green apple. In the taste, sugary, green apples, and green grapes. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Good, but a bit sweeter than expected, and a nice small tart fruit note."
506,58482,marcpal,"12oz bottle with an ugly, oldschool label that shows this is a one-off brew. Loved this beer at the event a few weeks back and was unhappy only to grab the last few bottles left for sale and would've loved more. Just hope this one starts getting mass produced. The first low abv WB brew that has really blown me away. A: Clear gold, looks like a Belgian- almost the appearance of Duvel hue without the monster head. Still ample foam and spidery lacing that doesnt go anywhere fast. N: Spices, coriander, orange rind, lemon rind. Grassy, hoppy notes a bit biting. Clearly has doughy flavors coming my way and banana yeasts. T: Complexity for the low alcohol- sweetness, fruitiness, hops and spices all take their turns. Stronger flavor profile warmed down a bit. Little bit of dishwasher detergent, but oddly not in a bad way. M: Spices dominate like a good Belgian. Full, doughy and chewy. D: At 6.2%, could drink this all day in any season. Refreshing and tasty- would love to see this one replace House, Muse, Scotch or one of their other more ""session"" oriented beers. Many dont rave about this one, but I do. Completely delicious."
507,58482,Deuane,"On gravity fed firkin cask at The Drafting Room, Exton. A-An odd, cloudy/milky golden yellow with a thin white head that left minimal lace. S-Wheat malts, an odd yeast funk and citrus hints. T-Sweet bread up front followed by spice, citrus hops and a bit of funk. A very interesting combo. M-Medium-light body with a fair amount of creaminess. Little carbination, to be expected from a firkin poured brew. Felt somewhat thin. D-Interesting for sure...but something is simply not quite right. A good attempt that may need to be revised."
508,58482,rodcom,"Had a growler of the Alpha beer the second night after they cracked open the firkin at the Drafting room in Exton PA. Overall very glad I tried the beer. It is a very unusual taste, color and feel for a beer. First the color/look - pale yellow color, but the yeast leaves it cloudy and there looked to be chunks as you poured it in the glass. Taste wise it was kind of a blend between a Belgian Pale and a wheat beer. Feel - it was a beer you felt like you were chewing it. Usually, I like the warm of a cask style beer, but in this case think it tasted better after I put the growler in the fridge for the second night. My recommendation - definitely try a glass of this beer when you get a chance since it is so different though not positive you will like it enough to try a second, but you will be able to say you had a ""firkin""."
509,58482,Biscuit033,"A: Cloudy/milky straw-golden with a thin had and some lace. S: Citrus hints and spice dominate witha tiny bit of grain. T: Slight sweetness up front followed by coriander and other spices typical of Belgian yeasts and a very tiny hint of funk. M: Medium and creany with subtle carbination and a slightly dry finish. D: This was a good experience from the firkin and though, at 6.2% ABV, not quite a session something that I would have a few of."
510,58482,Med,"Firkin at The Drafting Room in Spring House. A - Opaque but not too light. A tan color with very little head or lacing. S - Here is where the Belgian yeast starts to show itself. Bubble gum and some citrus with a definite hop presence. T - To me this beer doesn't quite know it's place in the world. It's got some of the ""wheatiness"" of a wit as well as some of the ""bubble gum"" noted in the smell, but an American hop profile. Pleasant, but not something I'd go out of my way for. M - Medium bodied with low carbonation. The fact that this comes from a firkin has a lot to do with this. D - Pleasant. Not bad at all, not great, but pleasant. Certainly an interesting interpretation of a style underrepresented in this area."
511,329435,WoodBrew,My old neighbor from Oswego gave me a can of this. The beer poured a hazy orangish with white head that is leaving a nice ring lace. The scent had floral hints. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with potpourri presence. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it's a solid beer.
514,329435,FBarber,"Pours a bright matte colored orange. Completely opaque even when held to the light. Thin white foamy head lingers on top of the beer for some time before dissipating. Aroma has notes of orange, tangerine, orange blossom honey, with a nice cracker malt backbone and a touch of green hops. Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, orange blossom honey providing a touch of sweetness. Bit of a rindy bitterness that is cut with the sweetness. Nice fruity flavors accentuated by the sweetness. Overall a very nice flavor profile. Feel is medium to full bodied, mild carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. Overall another very good above average NE style IPA from Triptych."
519,104824,Karl_M,"Can I say, ""Fuck you, Goose Island""? Just curious. If you don't get your tounge wet with this brew, then you have not had the best bourbon barrel aged stout ever. Vanilla bitterness and cacao darkness blanket this milk stout with the rounding out needed when in the presence of the blessed bourbon sweetness that comes from a freshly emptied cask. The lack of fizz upon pouring and subsequent headless beer in my mug of 5000-mile-old motor oil had me wondering if I'd recieced a dud and dude, it was not a dud. Let me tell you... The carbonation was felt on my tounge from the first heavenly sip through the last savory drop. The words I have cannot describe the decadent internal bliss that is swelling inside me. Batch 209."
520,104824,timc100,"Batch 209 - Big, bold, imperial stout - very dark, mocha head, thin barrel-charred lacing. Incredibly pronounced note of raw bourbon - caramel and booze. Other barrel notes of char, oak, vanilla as well as incredibly dark, bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. The finish is spectacular - very strong, as if it actually gets bigger. Fresh from the oak - this is very barrel forward with tons of whiskey, and in every way fantastic."
530,104824,blankenhoney,"12oz bottle from PW batch #75. Pours very dark with a light frothy head; looks kind of like a glass of cola. On the nose is pungent alcohol, baker's chocolate, and notable sweetness. Taste is rich and intense: bourbon-soaked raisins and dates, creamy chocolate, and lots of burnt brown sugar. But the barrel character tends to overwhelm those more subtle flavors. It's a milk stout, so mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not too thin: smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, this one suffers from the overpowering barrel character, and all the flavors of the original Jones Dog get snuffed out rather than enhanced."
551,97487,GJ40,"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Thanks surge1311! This one foamed over upon uncapping it. It didn't explode out but it came in a pretty solid initial flow then continued to bubble for some time. A - A deep golden with a very hazy finish and a big white head (bordering on too big). S - Lots of contributions from the wheat with a grassy, lemony aroma. T - Crisp, clean and dry. Maybe a bit too dry. Nice flavors from the wheat with a slightly tart finish. The maple syrup is faint but contributes. M - A moderate consistency with a high carbonation giving it a lively feel. O - Very refreshing. Between the foam-over and dryness, I think this one over attenuated in the bottle but it was good."
555,97487,HuskyinPDX,"Bottle opened on 10.21.13 A - Pours a hazy dark honey-orange with a huge fizzy light tan head that fades fast. S - Lots of wheat, canned corn, no maple. T - There it is. Crisp wheat with a touch of maple sweetness. D - Tons of carbonation with a light body. O -- Crisp, light and refreshing with a hint of maple."
556,97487,stakem,Bomber into a matching Lawson's snifter. The brew appears a clear golden yellow color with a firm white cap. Some patchy lace sticks to the glass and overall the brew is pretty nice looking. The aroma is grainy wheat with grass and sulfur notes. A little fruity to floral aspect in the back. The nose is pretty simple but clean and enjoyable. The flavor is lightly fruity almost with a hint of something like cider. Some wheat and sulfur are also thrown in there. A faint watered down with a hint of something like earthy maple syrup in the aftertaste. This is a light bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation. A strange and unique combo of character. The fruity apple notes were not expected and didnt quite work.
561,97487,VelvetExtract,"A-Pours a cloudy orange hue. Thin, fizzy head grows and falls quickly. Nearl zero lacing. S-Not getting much maple, if any. It's sweet and wheaty with a light, nearly funky aroma. A bit clove. T-Flavor is again, devoid of maple flavor but it's decent all around. A bit of light funkiness, almost tastes Bretty. Wheat and a lasting but not intense sweetness. Some spicey clove. M-Too carbonated. Bubbles expand over the tongue. Very light and otherwise drinkable. Refreshing. O/D-Fairly tasty. Could use more maple but the beer's base is interesting enough."
570,92742,TheManiacalOne,"On-tap 3/15/2013 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI, served in a weizen glass. A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. S: The aroma is very faint but contains caramelized malts, some hops and some citrus. T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty but not too heavy malt character. Then some mildly sweet flavors of caramel and citrus come in. The hops presence is decent in strength, distinctly German and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly bready and slightly hoppy. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean. O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a very long time."
571,92742,Flounder57,"Having on draft at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. Appearance: This beer poured a small head that reduced to a small layer. It is a thick looking golden straw yellow that looks similar to their hefeweizen. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank. Smell: cloves, bready malts, bananas, and some sweet malts. Taste: Same as above with mild hoppy flavor and bitterness to the beer. Its just a hoppier version of their hefeweizen. Picking up a little citrus and pine in there. Interesting. Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, low to medium carbonation, a little chewy, and a little hop bitterness too. Overall: This beer should be categorized as a hefeweizen, but this one is hoppier than their normal version. Still very tasty."
573,92742,ThePorterSorter,"On tap @ the Blue Monk in Buffalo The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with 1/2 an inch of a fluffy white head that fades quickly and laces. The nose is a sweet honey forward, wheat/corn, yeast, hops (slightly citrusy), and a hint of bubble gum. The taste presents much the same with malty/honey sweetness upfront that becomes more of a banana bread/ripe pear sweetness as it warms, and is carried on by a residual citrusy sweetness...still no true hop presence. It's light-medium bodied, effervescent, easy drinking, slightly yeasty, obviously sweet, sort-of hoppy, but nothing I'd classify as being ""bitter."" This is a slight push towards being a hoppy lager, but I'm unimpressed by the attempt."
575,125646,braker649er,"What beautiful beer! L: The name calls it. Lovely orange-cold, thick as juice and cloudy as glacial runoff. S: There's orange but also tropical fruit. I picked up a pine scent similar to how the pith of a mango has pine. T: Juice comes first and... wow! What took me by surprise is that the malt is detectable, too. F: Just so damned smooth. Again, like glacial runoff, but juicy instead. O: Worth seeking this out via a trade. Poured from a can to a tulip glass. Had side-by-side with Spirit Crusher, a similarly hazy DIPA from Seattle's Holy Mountain. Also from a can created about the same time! An interesting East-West experiment with both winning, in my opinion. The New England beer predictably nailed its own style with the aptly named Haze. And the West-coast brew brought Washington state hops to the table in a very similar style. I'd say Spirit Crusher might've been even more orange-juicier, just in the way that it was more like orange-juice concentrate. Maybe more hop bite, too. Like tasting a hop off the vine. ""Haze"" may have been slightly more refined, which is odd to say because both have punch and smoothness. Balance. And surprisingly similar beers!"
581,125646,hopsputin,"a: hazy (surprise surprise) bright burnt orange color. there is a very vibrant caramel color in here as well which looks just like one of those caramel candies. head pours 2 fingers, solid bright white. it settles to about 1/2 finger pretty quickly though s: pineapple, mango, and apricot up front - very juicy. behind that is a big sweet malt aroma along with a slightly bready presence, which is making up the backbone of the beer. there is a hint of some herbal hops in here as well as a sweet citrus smell towards the end. this smells juicy and sweet t: pineapple, kiwi, and juicy melon are the two flavors in here that hit you right away. behind that is a big hit of sweet malts, with just a touch of syrupy sugar that you get in most DIPA's. bitterness in here is very muted, and there is just a tiny touch of pine on the sides of the tongue. the finish is sweet, with just a hint of booze m: medium mouthfeel, but not as syrupy/sticky as many DIPA's. carbonation level is somewhat low o: interesting take on a DIPA here, for me. the melon in the flavor makes this quite a refreshing beer. and the fact that the mouthfeel isn't sticky makes this highly drinkable. it is a bit lighter in the mouth, but that gives it a unique quality. be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you"
586,125646,Hyptochrons,"woahhh this one had way more dankness than any of the other TH beers ive tried! up front there is some juicy orange and a hint of stone fruits, definitely getting that peppery spice and some bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit peel and pine needles on the finish ... everything is pretty mellow and blends together except this massive dankness throughout. mouthfeel is on point. overall very enjoyable and quite different than most TH to my taste."

599,97487,maximum12,"Thanks to damienblack for this bottle among other eastern treasures; wanted this one the moment I heard about it. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. The pour, conducted expertly by my 11 year old daughter, is fraught with overcarbonation. Head overtops the two goblets & gets all over my poor daughter, who now smells like beer. Hope the child welfare people don’t stop by. Nose is wheat &…funk? Funk. Not sour, more like saison-level funk. Not liking where this starts up. Lawson’s Maple Wheat is half right, at least. No hint of maple anywhere in the near vicinity. Overwhelming dint of funkiness slashed, but not enough, with grain & raw wheat. The effect is something of a cross between Jolly Pumpkin & a traditional hefe - & it’s not good. The stupid carbonation inhibits what enjoyment I might have been able to pull out of this; 11 ounces is far too much. I can’t believe this was the brewer’s intent. Funk, overcarbonation, missing maple all point to the start of an infection, or something unpleasant. Perhaps my first bad beer from Lawson’s. A drain pour disappointment."
607,97487,Chriscrundwell12,"22 oz bottle poured into a Lawsons Pint Glass A- ALLOT of carbonation, pours a 4 finger really frothy white head, dissipates very slowly. Allot of bubbles coming off the bottom. Golden/brown color, slight haze appearance. Big bubbles stick to the sides of the glass. S- The aroma is nice, very subtle overall. Clove, banana notes, yeast, malt, spice, slight corn aroma. T- Taste is a little underwhelming. Very similar to the aroma, clove, slight banana, wheat is present, slight yeast characteristic, very light, cannot pick out any maple notes, its refreshing. M- Very light mouthfeel, clean crisp finish, really carbonated. O- Overall would have liked the maple to come out a little more would have made this beer much more interesting. Its not a bad beer, but its not something i would buy again. Should have opened back when the weather was warmer, very refreshing, perfect for the summer."
617,104824,Vonerichs,"I had this at fobab but didn't tick, so I'm pleased they bottled it (though a hefty $7 for 12oz.). Inky black and opaque body. Coffee colored surface head. Looks viscous. Great aroma. It's smells like s'mores... Graham cracker, chocolate, toasted marshmallow. Heavy oak and vanilla characteristics. BT is my go to bourbon so I'm excited for the taste. It doesn't disappoint. Heavy vanilla and chocolate. Char to a lesser extent. Woody, toffee, molasses. It pulls the heavy spicy rye characteristic and displays it in a long finish. Heavy and lingering sweetness in the mouthfeel. Boozy but smooth. Well done. Dispute the price tag I'm glad it's a 12oz serving. It's quite filling but delicious."
621,104824,Alieniloquium,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance - Pours without a head on a black body, just a bit of transparency at the edges. Smell - Lots of oak. Huge barrel character. Bourbon. Some chocolate and a bit of molasses and caramel behind it. Taste - Again, it's almost all barrel. Oak and a sharp bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor never diminishes, although the oak flavor comes back in the end with a bite. Molasses more prominent with some dark chocolate that never reaches the fudge-y heights of Game of Jones. A little bit of lactose sweetness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel - Booze and barrel all over this. Medium-low carbonation. A sipper for sure. Overall - If you like bourbon-dominated beers, this is for you. If you like to taste the beer back there, this is not for you. I happen to really like bourbon, although I think I would prefer to drink it straight over this."
628,104824,Circles413,"What can I say about this beer? It's absolutely amazing in every way. I do prefer a stout to be a little thicker in body but the bourbon burn & rich dark tastes make up for it. It's very drinkable & well balanced the more it warms up. Absolutely, amazing!!!! ***update*** I came back to this beer & had to update/edit my review. This beer is perfect!! This stands just as tall as BCBS. If you miss out on this beer it's a shame because this is amazing!!!!"
629,104824,mfnmbvp,"12 oz. bottle, with handwritten Batch #75 on the label. Ah yes, at long last I have finally acquired one of these elusive barrel aged Pipeworks offerings. The label lists this as Tales From The Oak - The Jones Dog. ""Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with cacao and vanilla added"". My expectations are interstellar; Pipeworks makes some of my favorite stouts. It's probably gonna be pretty epic. Poured into a clear balloon snifter. A - Straight pour down the center produces no head, just a few mocha bubbles. Body is a dark woodsy mahogany-cola color; just a few shades away from black. Some sticky alcohol lacing when given a swirl in the glass. Looks very nice. S - Ah yes, this thing smells truly amazing. I would dare to say this smells nearly as good as Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, if maybe a touch boozier. Bourbon booze heat, woodsy barrel character, creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate, cookie dough, & hints of tart rum soaked dark fruit. T - Absolutely delicious; everything I hoped it would be. Smooth creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate / cacao, roasted coffee bean bitterness, earthy / woodsy barrel character, bourbon alcohol heat, caramel / toffee, and some hints of dark boozy fruit (raisin, date, plum, green apple). Delicious. M - Feel is silky smooth and creamy. Sticky & sugary - it would make an ideal dessert beer. Full bodied with extremely low lying carbonation. Moderately high 11.00% abv is mildly apparent, but tolerable. Overall, it was nothing short of delicious, however I think Pipeworks is capable of making even better barrel aged stouts than this. There is no telling what amazing things these guys will do in the future. Definitely one of my favorite Pipeworks beers I've had the privilege of drinking, and probably the best of their stouts so far. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries. Highly recommended, I can't wait to get more of these. Pipeworks Barrel Aged Imperial Jones Dog ---4.5/5"
643,137932,plaid75,"Poured a hazy straw hue with a two finger frothy white head. There was good retention and very good lacing. The smell featured a light grain and easy ester. The taste was offered grainy malts, a grassy hop and delicate ester. The mouthfeel was typical of the style. Overall a tasty ale."
667,144464,orangesol,"Served on-tap at Al's of Hampden. Pours murky pale yellow with a small half finger white head, dissipating down to nothing and leaving no lace. Smells of fuzzy kiwi skin, pale malt, light basement must, lactic sourness and a bit of sweetness. Taste is pretty bright kiwi initially quickly being joined by the dulled must, malt and sourness combo. Tart feel with plenty of lingering dryness. Overall a pretty solid sour ale. I get plenty of kiwi and it is definitely not a mouth destroyer which is A-OK in my book. Definitely worth a pour if you are into sours."
673,97719,kylehay2004,"This one is on hand pull so the thick head stays around for a while on a cloudy copper and burnt orange body. Aroma of resin, citrus, caramel malts. Flavors are malt forward with both pale and caramel malts coming through. Hops more on the pine resin end with subtle sweet citrus notes. Nitro with medium body. It's not a bad beer just not very exiting. The hops used were cascade and legacy. Worth trying."
681,281840,HipCzech,"Sampler glass poured as a flight at the Parksville taproom (visited 26-May-17). Lightly hazy golden yellow with a modest white head.

684,81821,karait95,"A: Yellow color, a big white crispy head that dissipates slowly and leaves a lot of traces on the glass, mostly small bubbles formed it and the carbonation is rich forming a think layer on top, good looking but average color. S: Smell and flavor are very connected and have a clear base of peach, the fruit is very clear. T: As with smell the base is peach and then the backbone of malts, hops are almost not present. M: Manly sweet due to the fruit, but sensation is not exuberant as could be."

695,81944,CaptainRaisin,"At Jackie O's. Bury me out back when I'm dead. Pitch black, oily, opaque. No light shall pass. Woah nelly. This smells amazing. Walnuts, chocolate, coffee and a tinge of booze. My goodness, immediately catapulted to the top of my favorite stout list. The walnuts, coffee and chocolate and playing games with me. I think I may fall over. Here comes some smoke. Then tobacco. This gets better with every sip. Thick and oily. I don't want it to leave. It is as proper as a stout could feel. Wonderful. The words ""world-class"" come to mind. Wish I could have this all the time."
697,81944,ehammond1,"Growler (Hand-bottled test batch) Thanks for opening this with me, DarthKostrizer! Black throughout with a very small, minimal dark brown head. There really isn't a lot of visible carbonation here. This leaves the glass oily and slick. The aroma is incredibly nice. There's plenty of dark roasted malt character, sweet vanilla and whipped cream, mild coffee, and nut character. Complete and decadent. The flavor, too, is stunning. It's rich, roasty, creamy, and complex (earth, vanilla, whipped cream, and nut). The flavors are well integrated and the alcohol is well hidden though not completely masked. Very nice. Medium to full bodied with very low carbonation. Creamy and incredibly drinkable. Simply fantastic."
698,81944,UCLABrewN84,"0% Thanks to DarthKostizer for sharing this one at his tasting. Test batch 1. 2012 vintage. Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, nuts, sweet vanilla, and wood. Taste is exactly the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors."
700,125646,Hawkeyejam,"Look- thick pineapple juice with a little OJ thrown in as well Smell- Nice and Airy. Got whiffs of peach, mango, orange. A bit of pepper undertones Taste- Really nice sweetness. Starts off with Melon and Earthiness. Flavor crescendos into sweetness like biting into a juicy peach. You can taste the hoppiness of this beer without a major bite. It's really enjoyable Feel- carbonation and fullness really shine. Tree house is known for creaminess. This may be the best they offer in this regard. Overall- a real sleeper. Very drinkable. The feel as good as anything out there. Just quality. Not my favorite but I can understand why it would be someone's. A dark horse"
704,125814,mactrail,"Clear golden color with a brief wisp of foam in the chalice. Aroma of lemon is quite pleasant. Lacking in any sort of yeasty aromatics even though they call it a Hefeweizen; correctly categorized as an American Pale Wheat. The mouthfeel is crisp and feather light. It could have more carbonation for a near flavorless beer. This is more promising than the couple of other brews I've had from this place. Not much to brag about, though it's a perfectly gulpable beverage if you like the kiss of fruit. Current version in the 12 oz can is 5% ABV. From a northern Washington beer store."
707,125814,superwho24,"Nice thick white head. Sweet flavor picking up biscuits and honey. Wheats aren’t my favorite, but I really enjoyed this one. Thanks."
713,125814,Lone_Freighter,"Poured into a weizen glass, the appearance was a soft semi-burnt bronzed golden color that had about a two and a half finger's worth of white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Some speckled lace ran here and there, somewhat clingy but also sliding at the same time. The aroma shaped some super light banana esters against the normal clove spices, but seemed to come across somewhat light. Light bubblegum and sweet wheat slide in for a decent blend. The flavor was moderately sweet through the bubblegum, banana esters and sweet wheat. But once again, not very bold as I would have hoped for. Aftertaste had a touch of the sweet wheat and bubblegum. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt a bit more prickly than expected. The clove spice even had a bit more of unxexpected harshness to me. ABV did feel appropriate. Overall, not a Weihenstephaner in any sense, but somewhat worthy, perhaps. Maybe again for me."
719,125814,TheWiltChamberlainofipas,Slightly confused by this beer because by the name I was expecting a beer with some hefe characteristics this beer has just a tad of that. But in the pale wheat category this beer has more going for it and is very enjoyable with an easy light drinkablity. Grap a sixer of this on a hot day and you're set.
723,125814,Zeeiphone,Avg heff I've had before
725,125814,Tucquan,"Had this on 2015-05-05 in Bend, OR at Greg's Grill on tap I don't know what this is but its not a Hefeweizen. More like a very bitter, tart Pilsner. Ratings reflect both a deviation from style and that I didn't like the taste."
730,125646,Kevin2Smith,"Great head, but a little too sweet for my taste"
732,125646,FBarber,"Pours a matte light yellow-orange color. Looks like OJ. Completely opaque. Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind. For the NE style IPA this is an excellent appearance. Smell is pungent and permeating - strong notes of orange, tangerine, peach, mango and passionfruit all are noted. Taste follows the nose with lots of strong citrus flavors - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - along with some peach and mango initially. Quickly transitions to some English biscuit like malt, some grassy hop notes, and dry hopped flavors. Almost no bitterness although you certainly get lots of hops flavors. Feel is medium to full bodied, thick, yet extremely drinkable. Moderate carbonation is perfect for the heft of this beer. Smooth dry finish. Overall this is a fantastic NE style IPA from Tree House. Certainly lives up to the expectations."
733,125646,brewandbbq,"16oz can dated 9/14/17. Pours cloudy, opaque gold with a short-lived head of tight white. Minimal lacing or retention. Aromatics are lush with fresh peach and orange sherbet. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Peaches, orange, and candied grapefruit on the palate. Minimal bitterness, zero malt, and quite dry. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit. Great beer. Loads of peach character, very smooth, and insanely drinkable for such a hop-bomb."
738,125646,Zbeattie6,Favorite IPA from Tree House
750,139404,AngusOg,"I haven't had a ton of Altamont's house beers, but up until now all have been just ok, nothing offensive, but nothing great either. This one is appropriately named IMHO, because they really ""stepped up"" their game with this one. Really nice dank, hoppy nose and taste, really dry finish. Delicious. I could def see ordering this one again if given the chance. Good job Altamont, keep steppin up."
756,279907,barnzy78,"16oz can, PKG 5/8/18. Hazy apricot body with a foamy off-white head. Huge juicy & tropical hop aroma. Tropical fruit punch flavors with notes of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, guava, and passion fruit. Smooth medium body, modest bitterness on the finish. Good hazy pale ale; great aroma!"
757,279907,jvgoor3786,"Poured from a can dated 5/8/18 from mschrei. The beer pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a thick, foamy white head and thick lacing. The smell is dominated by tropical notes, pineapple, and a little stone fruit. There's also some very bright citrus underneath. The taste is a deep tropical/dank/bitter combination with pineapple, mango, and even a bit of coconut. There's some of peach in there also. The mouthfeel is thick and velvety for a 5.75% APA. There is a lingering bitterness on the finish. Overall a very nice APA with tons of flavors."
759,279907,Jeffgosia6,"Good pale ale, but over hyped at Binny's ""limit one 4 pack per customer"" and overpriced (many others readily available for considerably lower prices)...but a good quality beer."
760,279907,vikingpillager,"I had high hopes for this beer after Megabite and Hoppy Days, especially at a relatively mild 5.75% ABV. Smell is nice and color is OK but this is a straight-up pine cone bomb. Strong bite and quite bitter, can't imagine IBUs are any less than 80... Stark contrast to even Hoppy Days.."
761,279907,GuyFawkes,"Canned 5/8/18; drank 5/13/18 @ the Yarchives. Cloudy orange/yellow appearance; champagne bubbles throughout. A violent pour yielded a huge bright white head; thick, frothy lace. Peach & pine notes in the nose. Sticky medium mouthfeel. Pine & peach flavors up front; a tangy bite on the finish. Old model IPA vibes here; not super pleasant or enjoyable, but not an abomination either. I've had my last."
762,279907,emerge077,"Slightly hazy orange, ample foam and lacing. Peachy aroma, slightly tropical with hints of mango and passionfruit. Taste is similarly fruity, peach, mango, and passionfruit with a dry and resiny bitter grapefruit peel finish. Light bodied with a soft but lean feel. Overall it’s a nice APA, pretty drinkable with a pleasant hop character."
765,279907,chicagocraft,Killed it again!!
766,279907,stortore,"16 ounce can into a Hop Butcher stemless teku glass. Canned 5/3/17, had 5/30/17. Pours a clear, pale golden color, with a one and a half inch head and some soapy lacing. Smells of Citra and Mosaic hops- grapefruit, orange, some pine, a little lime, light malt and yeast. A little dank. The taste is a little more Mosaic than Citra- pine, resin, grapefruit, orange, lemon, light lime, a little melon, malt. A good amount of bitterness throughout, and again, a little dank. Smooth, well carbonated, a good body. There’s no doubt this is all about the Citra and Mosaic. Really good flavor, good aroma, an easy drinker."
776,92925,therubicon,Appearance and smell much better than the taste. Very thin as well.
784,47604,rodbeermunch,"Pours a light orange color, impressive clarity, good 3/4"" white head on it, average in the retention/lace aspect of the appearance score. Aroma gave up the mild hops, sweetness and light rye feelz. Taste didn't impart the rye though. Light caramel and hop flavors, grapefruit. Good bomber price, but ultimately, being simply a decent ipa isn't going to lead me to purchase another bomber when there are so many 4/6 pack prices from awesome breweries beers (SN/Lagunitas etc. . . )."
785,47604,daave1,Just not good... Skunky and messy all around.
799,47604,aquazr1,"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Orange gold in color, mostly clear with little head. Not much nose. Rye is distinct but not as prominent as I would like. All in all an average beer."
801,47604,Ryancthomas7,I was hoping for some strong rye notes from this beer. They should definitely try a Jacaranda from Claremont Craft Ales and figure their ish out. This beer was no Bueno. Need. More. Rye. Very average beer. Disappointed. =/
807,47604,jooler,It's like alpine ale but more hoppy
809,47604,salcedo,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass L: Nice orange color. Very clear. Delicate, off-white head S: Toasted malt. Hint of acetic acid (vinegar) T Toasted malt with a tart crispness. Slight cidery aftertaste. I'm trying to learn what flavors rye adds to a beer, but I'm not sure I taste it here. F: Body is on the thin side of medium. Well carbonated. O: This is a nice beer. More complex than your standard pale ale, but could still drink this all night long, especially with some good hearty BBQ."

812,47604,mr-jj,"On tap at congregation ale house Slightly hazy gold color, aroma of pine and rye bread, taste is balanced. Rye is present but not overwhelming, moderate bitter finish, smooth mouth feel."
814,47604,RXUYDC,Disappointing. Thin and innocuous. Tastes more like a session beer. Where is the rye?
815,47604,SensorySupernova,"Appearance: Yellow-amber with a fluffy white head. Smell: Very strong floral and piney hops. I had this from a freshly tapped keg; your results may vary. Taste: Strong bitterness up front, into a rye and malt slightly sweet and very substantial backbone. Leaves a bit of resiny hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Pretty thick and moderately carbonated. Overall: Great IPA. The hop bill is nothing new, but the malt/rye backbone sets it apart from the standard West Coast style IPA. I had this from a freshly tapped keg and was blown away. I had it a few months later from the same keg and it was still great - the hop aroma had faded somewhat, but the grains were still delicious."
837,47604,artdob,"Orange golden in the glass with a classic off-white head. Looking good. Nose is light with yeasty easters, light lemon. Taste - classic styling here. Very well balanced. This one goes down easy with big points in the drinkability column. Hoppiness really comes through - IPA yes. Have had other ryes in the past where the rye really dominates. While I like that extreme, not really getting that here, though the beer is quite good. Carbonation is just north of mild. Sipping this one well chilled on a hot Southern California evening, this one hits the spot tonight. Given the solid drinkability of this beer, unfortunately my glass will soon be empty."
838,106164,bschinelli,"A - Poured from the bottle into a pint glass a reddish gold color with a beige 1/2 inch of fairly dense foam. Didn't really leave a lot of lacing and the foam dropped quickly into the glass, leaving a ring of muddy looking foam around the edge. I would have like a deeper red color. S - I pick up caramel, malt, sugar, pear Floods the nostrils with sweet caramel malt, candy sugar, pear, apple, and a bit of spicy, floral hops. T - Really good beer. I pick up some candied fruit, caramel, and a hint of - believe it or not - buttered popcorn! Starts and finishes with some hop astringency. M - Lots of malt smoothness on the tongue, decently heft. A bit of oily hop oils follow when you finish the beer. O - I liked this beer, it's really drinkable, favorably comparable to Lagunitas Lucky 13 or Revolutions Red Skull."
841,248633,SinjaminBentek,"On tap at the brewery poured into a snifter. Look: Dark purple. Smell: Tart blueberries. Taste: Nice blueberry punch, semi sweet with some tartness. Moutheel: Medium body. Overall: Tasty little blueberry kettle sour."
847,188173,radio2525,Very purplish and thick. You will like it or not lots of current flavor
852,84594,beertunes,"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a clean and clear golden amber color with an inch of of white head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma was a very nicely balanced blend of grain and hops that, while distinct, melded together nicely. Sadly, there was just a slight bit of cattiness that I found a bit off-putting. On the tongue however, the beer was all full, earthy grains and crisp hops that complemented each other very nicely indeed. The beer had a bit of a tart hop finish that lingered for a few moments. No sign of the kitty. The body was nicely medium, very smooth, easy and crisp. Drinkability was excellent, you could drink these all afternoon long and not get fatigued or bored. Overall, a very good take on the style that borders on excellent. A must try if you see it and worth a trip to the breweries tasting room if you happen to be in the Seattle area."
856,126245,Slatetank,"I enjoyed this on tap at DFH brewings and eats, review from notes. The color is deep amber with hazed clarity and light cream. The smell is strong and malty with sweet aroma and floral ester with light alcohol in the nose.The feel is sweet, strong and moderately carbonated with gentle toasted texture and light alcohol in the finish. The taste has a tinge of caramel malt with spice in the intial flavor with hint of yeast adding a fruity dried apricot element with mild floral tinges and slight peppery alcohol taste in the finish. Overall for being a double vienna lager it is very drinkable even though the abv is apparent in the taste."
858,366630,Cylinsier,"Tap Pours mostly clear honey golden, ring of a head. Aroma of honey, grassy malts and candi sugar. Flavor is of rich sweet candi sugar and honey malts. Some spices follow along with wine grape and lemongrass. Light grassy hop finish. Full body, tingly carbonation on the tongue. Warms going down. Solid strong ale with Belgian influences, rich and slow drinking. Worth trying for a heavier ale. The balance isn't quite right for a tripel but close."
869,99459,mendvicdog,"Brewery notes: Berliner Weisse. 4.0% Brewed with wheat. A very light and super tart interpretation of this classic German style. If you’d like, you can order Prof. Caterpillar with our house-made white peach syrup! -Notes of white grape, lemon zest, doughy wheat malt, and sunshine forever. End notes: So the sweetness definitely improves this beer for me. The initial sweetness is great but the syrup leads to a muddled finish."

F-Creamy with a slight fizz.........medium bodied....... O-Good drinkable brew"
873,197154,dd43,"I think this particular style is not well understood by a lot of beer drinkers. As the name suggests, this is a beer built to be paired with a midday meal. Per the style, it is low on carbonation, is decidedly malty, not overly pronounced hop bitterness, and easy to drink in terms of relatively low ABV. Pours with almost no head, which is understandable given how low the carbonation level is. Color of iced tea, and similarly hazed. Aroma is not pungent, but rather sweetly malty, like a lightly sweet biscuit or sweetened bread crust. Definitely a grain forward beer, flavor wise as well. Bready notes throughout, like whole wheat bread. Really pleasant to drink, no booze notes whatsoever. Goes down quickly and easily, the perfect libation to quench one's parchment after a hearty traditional english lunch of meat cheese and bread. Cheers!"
875,97487,kevanb,"650ml bottle, poured into a Lawson's Finest Liquids Tulip glass. The beer pours a nice, golden honey color with a clear texture and just a slight haze. Many bubbles rise to the top of the glass that boasts a fluffy, white head that has good retention and leaves a nice amount of soapy lace behind. The aroma is simple and while it showcases the ingredients, does come across a bit blandly, light hop spice, lots of banana bread with just slight maple and earthy bark profiles with some cracked wheat that lingers. A nice amount of mapley banana bread on the tongue, high levels of pale wheat grain, tree bark, a bit of crisp hop oil but the beer definitely reads as both sweet and savory with a lot of earthiness. The body is crisp, lively coats the mouth well. It comes across as very full bodied for such a light beer, which I really liked, the finish is nice, a bit prickly but quite smooth. Verdict: An interesting experiment, but I'm not sure this one really works. The maple presence is very soft and mild and doesn't really compliment the wheat, but it's saving grace is that the beer is quite refreshing. A rare blemish on Lawson's fine record of producing great beer."
877,97487,UCLABrewN84,"Bottle pour at mrbubbler's tasting. Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spice, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but there is no real noticeable maple presence in the aroma or flavor."
879,97487,LittleDon,"Hazy golden with small head. Grainy aroma with an unusual funk, possibly due to the maple? Lots of carbonation and very light bodied. Flavor is also very understated, cloves, bananas, grain, but very light. Finish is dry and clean. I could not detect any signs of maple."
884,97487,scotorum,"Six ounce draft at the Prohibition Pig pub in Waterbury Vermont, with dinner. a: Clear amber with a finger thick white head which shrank away to a thin surface foam film. t: To be honest, I only had a few sips of this, it was ordered for my beer-hating wife in hopes the maple flavor would appeal to her, while giving Curious George (me, my name was changed to protect me from warranted lawsuits) a chance to try another Lawsons offering. Maple flavor was almost non-existent, although the color was maple syrupish and there were subtle undertones of such. However, I liked it well enough, and she did actually drink most of it, which is no mean feat for a brewer to get my wife to do. So kudos to Lawson's, who probably had the wisdom to recognize that maple syrup and beer naturally do not mix very well flavorwise. m: Light to moderate. Quite smooth. o: Seemed like more of a low-hopped pale ale with a hint of maple flavoring than the wheat beer dominated by maple syrup which one might expect. But it's an interesting and good-tasting brew. Perhaps it should be renamed Lawson's Lawless Liquid or Moonshine Through A Maple Tree or The-Beer-Scotorum's-Wife-Actually-Drank-Five-Ounces-Of or something else which might make it irresistible. It may be too good to just call it what it is."
893,276550,curtis6290,"I found this to be a very mediocre beer, but solid from Grimm. Better than the average can or beer that you find around the city, but doesn't stand out to me."
901,276550,JerzDevl2000,"Bought this from Other Half a while ago and finally got around to it tonight. No date on the bottom this particular can though I realize that was over 4 months old by the time I cracked it open. Amazingly smooth and easy to drink, this easily ranked among the upper echelon of Other Half's offerings, which would be saying quite a lot! The pour to this was solid - murky, apricot, and topped off with a light and long-lasting spider web of a head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind though as there were only a few spots that remained on the side of my teku glass. Dank stone fruit, tangerine pith, and pineapple were in the nose with much more of those in the taste. Smooth and juicy, the citra could easily be felt from the first sip as the other, softer hops combined with the oats and alcohol to give this a muddled, depth and murkiness that lied underneath the surface. That slowly transitioned into a creamy sweetness as the lactose took hold, almost making this feel like a dessert beer when all was said and done. A light amount of carbonation ensured that the bubbles would stay in the background to odd-but-pleasing flavor profile of this brew that grew on me as I worked my way through this. This had enough alcohol in it but it wasn't too overpowering or a detraction. Rather, the heft of it enhanced the chewy mouthfeel and full body that this carried, down to the lingering slickness and sweetness that was oh-so-pleasing. What a winner here and a pleasure for those who love nuanced IPA's. Oats and spelt are great if used right, which was certainly the case here!"
908,92925,ChaBrah,"Sucks, just sucks. This has nothing on DogFish which is located pretty close by in the neighboring state of Delaware. This beer taste like its been brewed with penny's and skunked in the sun for months. Not impressed at all. For a beer that claims to come from Ocean City, MD yet its BREWED in Baltimore this is a scam. Cool name shitty beer, sad use."
909,92925,ThisWangsChung,"12 oz bottle into a wine glass. Appearance: Pours a murky chestnut color. The head is a finger high and off-white in shade. Its creamy texture retains fairly well, leaving a nice collar behind, as well as some lacing. (3.5) Smell: From first whiff, I can immediately tell these brewers were influenced by Schlafly's pumpkin ale - and I can't think of a better beer to be influenced by. I'm picking up plenty of vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses; while auxiliary notes of cinnamon and allspice stay in the background where they belong. There is a slight gourd character, too. One of the better pumpkin beers I've encountered, at least on the nose. (4) Taste: Aye...it didn't translate down to the taste buds that well. It starts off with that vanilla/brown sugar/molasses trifecta the nose indicated; on the other hand, the back end sees an upsurge of strong cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Once the palate properly adjusts to all the spicing, I'm actually starting to pick up a solid pumpkin flavor. After half a bottle, I finally start 'getting' this beer: it tastes less like pumpkin pie and more like...well, actual pumpkin. This deserves good marks for nailing the style guidelines quite well. It's not a glorified pumpkin soda, it's not a desserty pumpkin pie in a glass, it's just a beer with pumpkin and some spices (this is a compliment). (3.5) Mouthfeel: Despite the fuller body, it leans closer to dry than lush. No doubt, this is all helped by its decent carbonation...maybe TOO decent? At first, the drinkability is somewhat daunting thanks to the powerful spicing; after opening up, it becomes quite easy to down. (3.5) Overall: Oh man. If only this beer lived up to the aroma, it could have really given Schlafly's pumpkin ale a run for its money. Still, it's a rock-solid pumpkin ale, one that walks all over the lesser examples. Very well done, but it won't convert pumpkin ale haters thanks to its hefty spice characteristic. (3.5) 3.6/5: Solid pumpkin ale...but if only it tasted like it smelled...if only..."
910,92925,Bierleichen,"Very smooth, great balance of spices and pumpkin flavor without over doing it. very good beer."
912,92925,woodychandler,"My local, in-person trader, tone77, dropped this off for me recently, thus ensuring that my year of the pumpkin is not going to ever end. I like the style, but as with all styles, not all beers are created equal. From the bottle: ""Obscenely Fresh""; ""Hand Crafted""; ""If you drink like a fish swim home, don't drive - Fin City cares about you ... Drink responsibly!""; ""A tasty Brown Ale made with American malts, 100% real pumpkin, molasses, brown sugar and spices."" I will say this for it, following an initial pour - it smells pretty good! Once I had it all into the glass, I was looking at just over a finger of rocky, tawny head with decent retention. Color was more of a hazy orange (SRM = &gt; 17, &lt; 22) than a brown ale as noted on the label. The nose was intensely sweet with the molasses and brown sugar really taking the lead. I am curious as to how this will play out as I am not usually a fan of sweet anything, but conversely, I have had some pumpkin beers that were spiced to the point of saturation and I did not like them, either. Some nice lacing formed as the head fell while I was typing and so it was time for my first draught. Mouthfeel was medium and I was definitely getting cinnamon and nutmeg in the mouth, but the sweetness was there, just not in a cloying state. Hmmm. I was finding it quite quaffable and it was going down the hatch rather quickly. The finish had a pleasant dryness borne of all of the spices. It was not alum dry, but it was nowhere near as sweet as the nose had led me to believe."
913,92925,tone77,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty mahogany color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bursting with spices, some pumpkin. Taste is good, milder than the smell. A bit of pumpkin, some nutmeg, tasty and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
920,92925,DRBiser,"Pours a dark, murky amber. Perhaps a touch light on the carbonation but otherwise having the appearance of a rich ale. Light ring of bubbles that quickly fades Nose is toasted malts. Nothing special here but I'm actually glad I'm not blasted by spice, clove et al This is a nicely balanced pumpkin ale... I am not the type who usually likes the pumpkin-pie spiced out beers, but this one is balanced nicely. This dude won contests with this brew for a reason; the Madagascar vanilla beans and 100% pumpkin shine through, and using reserve with the spice has thing thing tasting more like Pumking than any other bollocks out there... The flavor is balanced in such a way that you can put down a few of these. It's a solid brew that i'd have again and recommend to all"
922,125646,jrenihan,"Lovely stuff. Orange and peach, a touch of passionfruit, a bit of a oily, herbal flavour. Pretty mild bitterness. Malt is very restrained. Creamy and smooth, alcohol very well hidden. Beautiful. A real pleasure to drink."

926,125646,kevanb,"16oz can, purchased from the Brewery, not sure the date, but known to be very fresh. Poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 3.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a very turbid golden color with orange hues that is very reminiscent of a glass of orange juice. A thick finger of white head rises with good retention and lots of spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit with some tropical pineapple, a bit of wildflower, sweet yeast, pale dough and some dank pine at the finish. The flavors really explode, lots of bitter pine up front, grassy hops, hop spice, grapefruit peel offer some more spicy bitterness with some refreshing tropical fruit juice with a sweet finish, pale grain, lightly yeasty. The mouthfeel is great, coating, creamy, medium body that has nice life to it with a dry and bitter finish. Verdict: A very nice DIPA from Tree House. Refreshing, bursting with flavor, well balanced, and as it warms, some pleasant bitterness comes out to contrast against the sweeter nature of the this beer which is much needed."
928,125646,HopHunter19,"A - nice murky golden orange amber color with a thick white head that sticks S - big peach, pineapple, mango, papaya, passion fruit, very ""soft"" smelling T - peach, papaya, mango, passion fruit, again very soft tasting. Little bit of hop resin/grapefruit. Has a creamy flavor it their too. It's like the whole milk of beer. M - light to medium mouthfeel. Very soft feeling. Alcohol completely covered. Feels more like 4-5% alcohol if that. Aftertaste is is peach, passion fruit, papaya. O - amazing. It definitely brings me back to when I first tried sap and Julius. It showcases that ""Tree House flavor that really doesn't exist anyplace else."

943,125646,Rristow,"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy gold with thick rocky white head. Incredible fruity aroma. Lots of orange with some grapefruit and lemon. Incredibly balanced. Flavors of orange, peach, grapefruit, pineapple with some floral and resin notes. Extremely drinkable. Incredible IPA."
946,279907,aleigator,"Pours a clear golden-orange color with a big, fluffy, stable white head. Offers a very intriguing hop profile on the nose, with a gentle diversity between herbs, grass, orange and lime zest. Got a nice sweet note from toffee malts, nicely adding to the juiciness of the fruits. Very refreshing, light bodied, well balanced with a soft effervescence and a challenging, perfectly integrated hop bite at the back end. Tastes of toffee accompanied lime zest, immediately establishing a hoppy dryness, thriving more complexity from a supportive grass note. Offers a short mineralic hint during midpalate, enhancing the hop presence in this, while the malts grow more profound as well. After the swallow this turns immediately surprisingly bitter, the hops now officially dominate the flavors with just a light note of sweet toffee cutting through. Very well made pale. Its hop flavors are challenging and diverse, while keeping everything in great balance. Can drink this all night, and it pairs very well with hearthy food."
947,279907,spacecake9,"A - Pours a golden orange color with a thick white foamy head. S - Very nice citrus aroma. T - Citrus up front with just the right bitterness on the finish. M - Medium mouth feel and carbonation. O - I'm very picky about Pale ale's because I prefer the stronger flavors and aromas in IPA's and DIPA's. But this is a good one, just enough citrus and bitterness. For some brewers, this would be their flagship IPA."
955,279907,Hopheadjeffery,"Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on May 6, 2017. Canned on 5/03/17 so super fresh. Look is light gold with a two finger head and lingering lacing. Smell is citrus, melon and dank hops. Taste is citrus and pine. Feel is light to medium in body."
956,279907,JeNSaYGooDByE,"L: Light golden (a golden hay / straw color). Good two finger head on an aggressive pour, with tight bubbles. S: Smell of faint citrus with notes of pineapple and melon with a side of dankness. All pretty light in scent, Wish it was more in my face (or perhaps nose) T: Good upfront flavor that dissipates quickly. Taste of light (water down) orange / lemon, perhaps a bit of a rind flavor and hitns of pine. F: The dryness almost drinks more like a IPA (in a good way) packs a good mouth feel without being too heavy or too light. Light carbonation, but it works for the style. O: Decent APA but am still looking for more the earlier Hop Butcher flavors such Alemerica the Beautiful."
958,125646,Wasatch,"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew, again. 16 oz. Can Canned On: 07/20/17 Poured into a Tired Hands glass a very nice hazy yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus off-white head, which also leaves some very nice creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, very nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, peach, grapefruit, lemon), with some nice diesel like. The taste is very nice hoppy, malty, very nice citrus comple (orange, tangerine, peach, lemon, grapefruit) nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very very well, with a very nice little dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a very very tasty brew. Addictive! MilkShake! Thanks Bill!"
959,125646,captaincoffee,"Fresh can from the brewery. Super excited to get this on the random day I was heading to TH. I was surprised how similar this is to Julius. Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is slightly bigger than Julius, but still didn't quite match what I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks. Overall, a great beer that didn't quite match the hype but was still a great experience."
963,125646,Greyvtrayn,"Canned 8/1. Deep orange with an inch and a half head that left nice lacing the whole way down the glass. Smell was a bit muted from what I was expecting but you get a nice nose full of papaya and peach plus a hint of grass/onion. Some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass. Tastes of pine, grapefruit, melon with a bitter backbone. Remarkably smooth despite the bitterness, very soft, modestly carbonated. No way you would know this is 8.2%. No doubt one of the best beers I've had in my life. TreeHouse is a hike for me but, this one was well worth the drive! If you have it, treasure it. If you don't, make the effort to get your hands on this."
969,47604,BucannonXC5,"Type: 22-oz. bottle Glass: Modern Times pint glass From: Hanson’s Market in San Clemente, Calif. Price: $4.29 Purchased: July 7, 2014 Consumed: July 10, 2014 Misc.: Tons of foam poured out of the beer after I opened it Poured a honey, orange, hazy color with six fingers of frothy, off-white head. Above average foamy layered lacing along the sides of the glass. Good-to-great retention on the top all the way down. Smelled earthy rye hops, wet Cascade hops, cantaloupe, sweetened iced tea, green peas, light asparagus, broccoli, corn chips and some caramel notes. Tasted a tad better than the smell, but still not that great. Got those earthy rye hops again to lead. Also buttery notes, cantaloupe, lemon grass, honey, sweetened iced tea, citrus hops, caramel, cough drops, lemon and some vegetable notes. Felt like a kind of cheap taste, but grew on me as it went down. Medium-to-light body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Could hardly taste the alcohol. This rye IPA really grew on me. Not too bad and a great value for the price ($4.29)."
992,47604,Aaron_Ramson,"Cloudy orange amber color with thin head; nice spiderweb of lacing left on glass mug. Nose of sweet juicy fruit gum ending on a botanical spiciness. Spicy kick of rye is up front on the palate with resiny, grapefruit and pine hop flavor. Ends on a sweet caramel and chocolate note. Aggressively carbonated with a medium thin mouthfeel."
1027,47604,DefenCorps,"A mildly hazy orange amber with a dense, off-white head, this is a decent looking IPA, The nose is quite solid, a moderate rye character along with some grapefruit and pine hops, this also has some tropical fruit character. Malt character is mild, a little bit of caramel is present. The rye is rather bready too. The palate opens with a blend of rye and grapefruit and a little bit of chalk. Bitterness is moderate, and there's a pleasant blend of fruit and pine. A touch of soap as well. The mid-palate is where the rye comes to play, rather spicy and bready. Sweetness is medium- medium-low with some honey present. Moderately drying and mildly bitter on the finish, there are lingering flavors of fruit and pine, this beer is a little watery. Solid"
1028,47604,maximum12,"Thanks to kyle2k10 for this bottle, one of about 98 extras from his box that I'm working through. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife after a good dinner out for my daughter's birthday this week...& watching my Twins get crushed. Again. Still. Plus, it's snowing. In mid-April. /end news feed. Pour is a dull orange that's about fourteen percent occluded; not quite cold filtered. Lowly carbonation. Nose is extremely earthy, mixed with tablespoons of lemon & citrus & orange. I'd say: appealing. Rustic Rye IPA is like biting into a piece of South Dakota farmland. Earthiness crosses into a swampy with dry, brittle windblown leaves in the mix. Mid-palate the hops arrive in good humor: pine, citrus. Orange, even. Finish is a sweeping, gentle bitterness & a final herbal potpourri. Half a bomber of this will do just fine, thanks. This veers towards saison territory...well, not real close, but much closer than most beers with 'rye' or 'IPA' on the label. Best thing one can say about the beer is it's...interesting. Pretty good beer."
1032,276550,Meyers1023,"Was lucky enough to have this both from a can and on draft. Absolutely amazing! It is a cloudy orange color with just about a fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell knocks you back as soon as it is poured. Full of candied citrus fruit with a small amount of dough and alcohol to finish off the nose. The flavor is a huge juice bomb upfront before easing into a bit of bitterness to even things out. The feel is a little thick and smooth from the oats and lactose. Again, an outstanding collaboration from two of the better IPA makers!"
1050,104824,Chriscrundwell12,"12 oz bottle poured into a Toppling Goliath Snifter Batch # 75 A- Pours a one finger dark brown head that dissipates to a thin brown ring around the glass. The color is dark black, cannot see through it. S- The aroma is big bourbon up front. Really nice, alcohol is very present. Slight dark fruit notes, but the bourbon takes over completely. T- Tastes ver much the same as it smells. The alcohol is very present. Really hot, could use some time to mellow out. Vanilla, brown sugar, really sweet. M- Silky smooth finish, big mouthfeel. The alcohol is very present but still goes down pretty smooth. O- Really impressed with this one. If you love big bourbon characteristics then this is the beer for you. Really impressed with Pipe works. Every beer i've had from them has been amazing!"
1063,104824,MNishCT77,"12 oz. bottle purchased at West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, IL; unknown bottling date but batch #75, shared with my wife over an hour while playing Uno A: 3/3 - deep dark brown-to-black with some purplish hues around the edges; initial small amount of carbonation settles into a lack of head (expected for a barrel-aged beer), big alcohol legs (again, to be expected at 12% ABV) S - 10/12 - Buffalo Trace bourbon notes - vanilla, tobacco, leather - with some background dark malts of the base milk stout; big alcohol aroma as well T: 17/20- the barrel-aged qualities are front and center on this one and complement the aroma - again, intense vanilla and brown sugar sweetness; in the middle of the mouth, the sweetness continues to lie within and, for me, becomes a bit overpowering (albeit my wife loved it); still it finishes with little residual sweetness; although it doesn't taste like 11% ABV, it definitely brings the heat like that Asian sugar baby wouldn't M - 4/5 - the wood-aged and bourbon presence is thick on the tongue with alcohol; low carbonation per style O: 8/10 - never had a milk/sweet stout barrel-aged before so kudos to Pipeworks for venturing out; as much as I love the notes from the BT barrel, it's too sweet for my tastes, but, for the right person with the right food or other accompaniment, this could be a great dessert beer to sip in front of a fire or in bed; not a bad deal either for $7.99 TOTAL - 41/50"
1080,97487,bonkers,"Thanks to my cousin Jeff for picking this one up for me. Pours a pale straw with a big foamy head. The aroma is sweet, with lots of spices. The beer taste like a below average wheat beer, some bubble gum, a little spice. I do not taste any maple. The beer is light, effervescent, and easy drinking. I was expecting more out of this brew, it was graded so harshly due to it lacking any maple flavor at all."
1081,97487,plaid75,"On draft at Prohibition Pig, Waterbury, VT. Poured a hazy bright straw hue with a one ginger got white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell was devoid of any maple element and essentially left me with some wheat spice and weak esters. The trade was likewise bland, with maple to be had. The mouthfeel was toward the lighter side of the style. Overall a poor beer considering the expected maple element."
1093,125646,KensWorld,From fresh 16 oz can. For a North East DIPA where's none better then this! Overall a near perfect beer.
1097,125646,sulldaddy,"Sampling my first Tree House beer. Excited to check out the hype and experience the brewery. Have some cans of other examples waiting for me. Pouring the can cold into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy orange juice color with no light passing through my glass. A bleached white creamy head of 2 cm rests on the surface of my glass and remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling. The foam leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass after each sip. Aroma is lots of fruit with some peach and apricot mixing with grapefruit and some orange as well. A little bit of rindy pith scents but otherwise fairly sweet and fruity on the nose. The first sip reveals a light body with very tingly carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer drinks very easy and is physically no challenge to consume. The flavor is all hops with lots of fruit notes throughout the sampling. I get hits of peach and grapefruit and then the middle is pithy citrus rind and slightly bitter flavor. This gives way quickly to a very orange flavor that is fairly sweet and lingers citrus on my palate. I do get sort of bready and creamsicle flavored burps occasionally but I dont get any detection of the 8.2% on the can. Very drinkable brew and definitely depicting juice characteristic throughout the stages of sampling. Definitely worth trying if NE IPA/NE DIPA is your thing, but also pretty enjoyable for anyone."
1105,252952,Lone_Freighter,"Poured into a mug, the appearance was a deep muddled burnt orange color with a thin cap of a white to off white foamy head that dissipated fairly quick. Moderately concave lacing hit the sides decently. The aroma starts off caramel and toffee malty sweet with some grassy sweet to bitter hops balancing in nicely. Slight dried clean earthiness. The flavor balances nicely between the earthy and grassy hops to the clean sweet caramel, toffee and bready malts. Very clean and nice. Superb clean malty aftertaste with a touch of nuttiness. Quick semi-sweet caramel-esque finish gracing a touch of the grassy hops. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Mild carbonation yields to the grassy hop bitterness having enough harshness. Overall, good Oktoberfest that I wouldn’t mind having again and perhaps with some soft pretzels and spicy mustard or even some bratwursts. Definitely a food beer."
1108,252952,Brad007,"Purchased in cans at the brewery. Pours a nice orange-gold hue with thin head into my glass. Sweet, crisp malt greets the nose. Fits this cold evening well. Grainy, chewy and sweet. Overall mouthfeel is about the same with a slightly dry finish. Fans of oktoberfest/marzens should definitely get this while it lasts."
1110,328688,Ronl12,"16 oz can into IPA glass. No date. Beautiful golden haze look. Nose is light citrus tropical fruit. Taste follows nose more cantaloupe and papaya. Feel is medium and creamy. Overall a very nice NE style IPA, not big juice bomb so its a nice change of pace. Would buy again."
1114,328688,swenny916,"Pours an opaque orange. About three fingers of white head after an aggressive pour. Very fruity on the nose. Citrus is what stands out. Taste has lemon and cantaloupe. Not sour by any means, but the lemon stands out to me. Very smooth and light. Easy to drink and a beer that could be the start of a nice session."
1116,328688,Packageguy,"Lemon drop hops? Lemony, minty, and herbal...yeah, that's what I'm getting. Definitely a little different than other Vanished Valley ales. From the color, to the taste, to the abv, everything about this one says, ""light and bright."" Seems perfect for a sunny summer afternoon...or, an unseasonably warm late winter day. I can't help but wonder about the name; is it a play on Seven Up? Maybe. A session ale? Crushable? Yes and yes. As I got to the bottom of the glass, it dared me to not have another one...which I did."
1119,125646,SPLITGRIN,Smell of pineapple and mango juice. Almost like drinking a blend of grapefruit and orange juice. Creamy body turns a bit dry in the finish. This is a lovely brew with almost no hop protein burn. Worth the hype.
1125,47604,AlexFields,"Pours a fairly clear, dark amber, nice head, solid but looks pretty plain though. Smell is pretty fruit, some oranges and grapefruit, but fairly sweet and malty, not aggressively hoppy. Some rye spiciness too. Taste is fairly bitter, not as much citrus as on the nose, lots of rye spice again and even more sweet maltiness. Pretty good but needs more hop and less malt. Lots and lots of fizzy carb, pretty full body, good mouthfeel overall. Good beer! Not remarkable but a solid rye IPA which is a style I always like. 6.8/10"
1127,47604,gusman61,"It is a happy beer. It lightens your spirit. It would be good morning fishing beer. I stumbled upon a nice Irish pub (gallagers) in Huntington Beach and was turned on to this. We were Not disapointed! After having visted a pub that served bud and the like, I was very happy with this find!"
1128,47604,Nixonbrew,"Got this at the ABC market next to Disneyland. Always enjoy a good Rye PA so thought I'd give it a try. Brewery in Fullerton, just up the road from the Magic Kingdom. A - pours a clear golden with a copper hint. Good carbonation and inch thick head of large bubbles that last for a short period and then disapate back into the beer. S - After a day walking around Disneyland this is the grand finale of the day. Excellent hop aroma. Fruity, citrus, grapefruit and a peppery smell T - Tastes as I imagined. Balanced hops, malt, rye fruitiness and pepper with a smooth bitterness. Tastes like a homebrew I made but drier. O - Worth the price to try a local brew made by a homebrewer recently turned craft brewer. Wish I could try more from Bootlegger's."
1133,47604,PintOHops,"Glass - Mug A - Bronze like color with a big Lager like head that looks pretty loose. Head retention was quite good. Tiny bubbles can be seen slowly rising to the top. Nice splashes of soapy lacing. S - Toasted sugars, molasses, caramel and a touch of rye. Herbal and orange hop characteristics are there but don't jump out at me. Seems balanced and drinkable. T - Pleasantly surprising orange/tangerine thing going on. Bold herbal and resinous hop flavors through and through. Moderately sweet with just a touch of rye bread. Finishes very bitter and dry with lingering resinous hop flavors. M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation and slight chewiness. O - I gotta say that i'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. Rye didn't jump out at me, but i found the beer to be a satisfying IPA, filled with resins and bitterness. Inviting look, and the price is outstanding. I picked up a mixed 12pack for $14, and can't wait to try the rest. I say try out the mix pack for sure. I'd buy again. Cheers!"
1134,47604,JosiahS,"a: Slightly cloudy dark straw color. 2-3 finger foamy off-white head that looks like it will stick around nicely. s: Smells of lemon rind, flowers, light tree sap, papaya, mango and grain. t: hoppy lemon, flowers and papaya up front and mid pallete. At mid pallete a nice toasted malt comes through. Finishes somewhat clean but with a small bitter sting. m: Approaching full-bodied, medium carbonation. o: A pleasant surprise from a local brewery."
1135,47604,lsummers,"Poured a rusty light orange with a one finger head Smell is very subtle, mild citrus hops with a touch of peppery malty sweetness. Taste is also not as bold as I was expecting. Mild bite of hops at first, grapefruit, and subtle grass that ends on a sweet malty peppery note. Overall, it's a very drinkable ipa. Nothing stands out, which would make this perfect for the back yard bbq. But if your searching for the added ""Rye"", this might not impress."
1136,47604,Therisse,"Appearance: Nothing too special about the looks of this beer. Crystal clear look, tiny bubbles, head sustained well but was small. Honey color. Aroma: Aroma was pleasant but once again, nothing special. It was also subtle. Specific smells included rye, orange, pine, and honey. Flavor: The flavor is what got me. I feel it had the perfect balance between piney hops and bitterness. The specific flavors I could taste were pine, rye, orange, wheat, honey, copper, and nuts. Very crisp. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was also amazing. It was creamy, plentiful amounts of small bubbles on the tongue, and a thick body. Overall: Perfect type of beer I'd like to drink on a hot day, but would also be amazing slightly below room temperature. This is nowhere near the hoppiest or the most bitter IPA I've ever had, but it is perfectly balanced."
1141,47604,ChugginOil,"Pours a very cloudy orange color with an inch of white head. Spotty lacing. The nose offers a ton of earthy and spiced rye. There is some faint tropical fruits but rye dominates. The flavors are compromised of a ton of rye. Spice, earthiness, and lovliness. This beer has one of the most noticable and enjoyable rye presence. Some bitter hop bitterness completes the flavor profile including some pineapple and apricot. The mouthfeel is appropriate, medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, loved the rye characteristics showing boldly here. Very enjoyable."
1145,125646,unclejazz,"We got you stuck off the real ness, we be the infamous. You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers. The mob come equipped for warfare beware, and so on and thusly. In addition to the opening to Shook Ones pt. 2, all I can say about this beer is fantastic execution."
1149,125646,Phineasco,"Look: Yellow, turbid, hazy, with 2 inch white head. Medium low carbonation. Smell: Candy, grapes, melon, and blueberry. Taste: Grapes, candy, bubblegum, and blueberries. Mouthfeel: Medium to light. Silky smooth. Overall: An outstanding IPA from treehouse."
1154,97487,GarthDanielson,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, unfiltered, orange-gold coloring, almost opaque, with a filmy, bright white head. Nose of toasted wheat, subtle citrus notes, maple sweetness, and hints of smoke. Flavors of smooth, roasted wheat, with a rich, roasty sweet maple backbone. Very balanced and smooth. Light, crisp citrus notes on the tail end of the palate. Smooth and slightly effervesced body. The aftertaste is tangy sweet with citrus highlights, and the finish is smooth and clean. Very easy to drink."
1159,97487,Hendry,"Cloudy orange amber,soft two finger white head, laces well in the glass. Aromas are decidedly European,yeast most particularly,maple nonexistent as are the hops. Sour splash to the palate on the first sip, reminiscent of a yeasty Belgian, and quickly changes over to a lager flavor profile while at the same time the slightest coating of maple finishes at the back. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation, nice mouthfeel. Okay, I love Lawson's, and have been a fan of their past maple offerings, but Maple Wheat takes an artisan approach that is certainly a different take on the style. While Maple Wheat may appeal to others with a more adventurous palate than mine, I found it interesting and worth trying once."
1162,104824,Florida9,"Pours with a visible viscosity. Looks flat. Only the tiniest bit of light tan colored head. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is full of chocolate, vanilla, and sweet, syrupy bourbon. Taste is more of the same. Very sweet and very chocolatey. Bourbon and barrel are there too, but the sweetness takes center stage. Full bodied and viscous. Very low carbonation. Creamy smooth."
1165,104824,NickyPogs,"Had this gem at FoBAB over the weekend and it was amazing. Haven't had many things aged in a Heaven Hills barrel, but if this is any indication of how good they are, I must try more. It was very sweet but had a really big kick on the back end. I wouldn't say it was hot, but you could get a good sense of the whiskey influence in this beer. I thought it was very well done and would love another opportunity to try this one."
1174,123949,zeff80,"On tap. Poured a clear, golden yellow color with a small, white head. It smelled of grains, caramel and floral notes. Sweet caramel and toasted bread. Very, mildly bitter."
1175,123949,DragonsMilk,"Good Pilsner, mabey it's something I drank earlier but Im getting a slight Belgian like flavor on this one, anyways... Crisp, a bit tart, a bit sweet, refreshing Pours clear golden, finger of head It's on par with most craft beers price wise @10.00 a sixpack but I prefer Cechvar/Budvar and it is also 10.00 a sixer even with importing so I wouldn't purchase this at the store often but in a bar if its available I would choose it over most AB, Coors, ect Of the 20 or so Nebraska beers I have tried of various styles this is one of two that I have not poured down the drain, the other also being from Brickway, their 10th Sanctum barleywine."
1179,123949,hopflyer,"Unknown canned date Pours very pale yellow with frothy one finger head. Retains well Smell is very muted. Faint Pilsner tones, grassy Taste is subdued grass and slight bitterness of noble like hops. Maybe some spice. Thin feel and higher carbonation. Crisp and clean. Best aspect of this beer Pretty tame in the smell and flavor dept. but the feel is nice. Average at best?"
1182,123949,The-Adjunct-Hippie,"Pours a bright, crispy golden yellow color with a tight 1 finger head. Lots of effervescent bubbles rising to the top. Really nice showing here. Crisp, floral aromas, bread crusts, and light fruit. Flavor follows suit beautifully, with a soft white bread flavor, pinches of hop, cracker, pale malts, and fresh orange. Very crisp finish. Feel is right on point, very refreshing, and again crisp. Overall the word of the day here is crisp. This is a near perfect pilsner. One thing Nebraska gets right beer-wise are their pilsners."
1186,123949,StonedTrippin,"a great beer here, my favorite i had from these guys, ice cold right out of the can, i really dug it. its got a little something different about it, not too cleaned up maybe, i taste more yeast than i am used to, its more than just what the yeast does, make it dry and crisp, but there is actually a soft bready flavor from it remaining in this that i really like. there is also a slight floral character to it, like orange blossom or something, gives it a little more liveliness than the hops can do on their own, and makes this pretty distinct. good bitterness on the back end and a lot of body for the style. creamy feeling, but well carbonated and incredibly easy drinking too. i know its not the sexiest sounding beer on the menu here (they have some pretty ambitious recipes working right now), but its arguably their best executed beer, at least of the several i had while i was here. its certainly one of the better pils types i have had out of the state of nebraska and around the region more generally. nice work here, this should get some legs now that the cans are up and running..."
1189,47604,WestCoastLibations,"For my first(!) review here on Beer Advocate, I wanted to pay homage to a local (of sorts) brewery, based in Fullerton, Orange County. While I am familiar with DTF, and the trifling nonsense which goes on there, I have always been interested in the city's brewery, which this beer gave me the perfect opportunity to get to know! Flowing out of the deuce-deuce, the beer came out the same color of the Fall leaves in the recent Charlie Brown Thanksgiving Special I just watched, yet when settled in the glass (proper IPA glass of course), the beer took on a darker color, almost Brown. From here, I knew it was going to be delicious. Sniffing it as the head decreased to mere layer of white, topping the abyss below, it smelled to me almost tame, with the Rye acting as a barrier of sorts from the onslaught some IPA's can bring. Finally tasting the sweet nectar, I was admittedly surprised by the lack of bitterness, which again, accompany many IPA's. While there was no shortage of Hops, there was still a cacophony of other tastes combined, going to create a unique, and...well...delicious flavor. Overall, with the combination of appearance, smell, taste, and personal notes, I was happy with the product which was sampled through 22 ounces, and about 15 minutes of bliss on a Friday afternoon. This taste from Bootleggers will most almost certainly bring me up the 55 Freeway sometime soon, to check out the brewery itself, nestled in the forest, known as DownTown Fullerton!"
1192,47604,tlazaroff,"Mild aroma bringing a slight spiciness, oranges, and a nice constant sweetness across the board. Pale orange and clear with a bubbly white adhesive head, about a half finger thick. Looks kind of like a pumpkin in color actually. Sweet almost candy-like orange flavors right up front and through the finish. It's almost like those gummi orange wedges covered in sugar. Nice spiciness from the rye hits the sides of my tongue and dances around. Slick mouthfeel, almost feels a bit wrong, but it works. Carbonation is low to moderate."
1196,47604,ngeunit1,"A - Pours a clear golden-orange with a finger of frothy white head. The head fades fairly slowly leaving behind some nice lacing. S - Aroma is a mix of sweet caramel malts and rye with some grapefruit and citrus hops and a touch of pine hop. T - Starts off with a mix of sweet caramel malts with some grapefruit, orange, and citrus hops with some bitterness. Through the middle, some light pine hop comes through with a bit more bitterness and some rye spiciness. The finish is a mix of sweet caramel and biscuit malts, rye spiciness, and some citrus and light pine hops. M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a dry, bitter, and lightly spicy finish. D - Very drinkable. Nice Rye IPA with a good balance of hops and some nice rye spiciness."
1197,47604,UCLABrewN84,"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain/rye and some very mild herbal hop aromas. Taste is slightly sweet and is of malt/grain/rye up front with some herbal hops on the finish and a slight alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but the smell is pretty weak in my opinion."
1203,47604,Philousa,"Clear pale orange in appearance with one inch of head. Some lacing as you drink. Surprising amount of tart yeast prevalent in the aroma to start. Very grassy, weedy hop aroma, not much pine or bitterness apparent. Pale malt is hiding behind the mildly spicy rye malt. That rye malt is very apparent in the flavor. Again, mildly spicy, full of flavor. I get a little butterscotch diacetyl, which I realize was in the aroma too, but I just couldn't place it. That grassy hop aroma comes out in the flavor as well. Not as bitter as I would expect an IPA to be, but it's definitely got some bitterness to it. Balanced feel, slightly dry finish. Interesting, but I'm ultimately nonplussed by this beer. Rather spend my money on something else."
1205,47604,Auracom,"Big thanks to Derek for the extra! 12 oz. poured into a Stone Old Guardian glass on May 16th, 2012. A - Lightly-hazy, dark-golden coloring. One and a 1/2 fingers of a vanilla-white head. Poor retention but good lacing. S - Relaxed aromas of citrus, notably orange juice and overripe lemons. There's just a hint of rye-like spices. Tiny bit of hop-cone pine tree, but it doesn't smell all that west coast. T - Further citrus and light pineyness. Spices are non-existent here. At rear palate there's a weird, exceedingly-bitter, warhead-candy sourness that feels very disjointed from the rest of the drink. It went from being subpar in reference to the typical to bizarre and atyipcal. M - Light-medium body, moderate-high carbonation. Astringent but doesn't finish very dry. D - I refuse to believe there's rye in this when I think back to other rye IPA's like Alpine Nelson. Not likely to visit this one again."
1208,47604,Drinkerofales,"The beer is clear, golden amber, with a huge light tan head that leaves tons of spiderweb lacing and takes a while to dissipate. Smells of grapefruit pith, warm malts and some rye as well. Taste is not quite as big, lightly bitter pith throughout, with a rye aftertaste. The two go well together, but the flavors are a little understated. Texture is light-medium bodied, a light bite, with a semi long dry finish. Medium drinkability, I probably wouldn't want more than one or two of these. The taste is somewhat lacking in actual hop flavor, as the only aspect is the citrus pith. Other than that, it's what it says it is, and does a pretty good job of it. DOA"
1216,125646,LAp,"Such an extraordinary beer. Poured from the can into a teku. Pours a thick, smoothie yellow. The nose and palate are bursting with tropical fruit, and there's an amalgamation of sweet citrus and hop here that works beautifully. Not many beers hit this level of excellence."
1222,125646,Masonz223,"Smell: fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh peach, papaya, tangerine, mango, yellow grapefruit, Bubblegum. A little bit of a green note. No real malt presence. It smells like a fruit smoothie. Taste: right upfront your smacked with fresh squeezed orange juice and juicy tangerine. Middle of the mouth tropical fruits come in to play peach flesh, mango, papaya a little bit of passionfruit.The flavors in the mid plate play with the creaminess of the beer to give it a fresh picked tropical fruit salad taste. The beer finishes with more of those citrus notes. Yellow grapefruit and orange. Some bubblegum, along with a light grassy earthy bitterness. Feel: Medium body. Moderate to full creaminess. Super soft. The beer just glides across the plate. Overall: Drinking this I can understand the treehouse hype. The hops in this beer are used to make a fruit bomb. the creaminess in the beer gives it a fruit smoothie like flavor in the mid plate. Almost no bitterness or malt presence. This is an A+ beer. One of the best double IPA'S out there!"
1224,125646,Lone_Freighter,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance lived up to it’s name, definitely orange haziness colored with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace. Sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly. The aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice, pulpy with big bitter balancing rind-like qualities. Sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma. The flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste. Excellent sweet to danky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium in body with a smooth sweet to bitter feel rolling over my tongue. Nothing clings, just feels absolutely awesome as it hits my tongue. Overall, hot damn, what an absolutely amazing DIPA. I would definitely have again."
1228,125646,frasergrove,"Pours a very opaque lightly orange tinged pale - nice head that leaves massive lacing. Aroma is juicy and tropical, some underlying biscuit. Flavor and mouthfeel are delightful, smooth and rich with nice bitterness. Tasty beer!"

1235,125646,Sinesipm,"Very delicious IPA, it's amazing that it's over 8 % alcohol considering you barely taste the hoppiness of the IPA."
1241,125646,JamFuel,"Pours a hazy dark orange, with soft, fluffy foam. Smell is very tropical. Main notes are peach, papaya and grapefruit. Taste is a total juice bomb. Peach, pineapple, papaya, grapefruit and a hint of dankness blends superbly with a perfect amount of bitterness. As all Tree Houses, soft and pillowy mouthfeel. Terrific juice bomb of a DIPA. Very drinkable, with no hint of the ABV. Another winner by Tree House."
1245,125646,WickedBeer,"Got this bad boy in a trade, can't wait to try it! Poured into a tulip glass from a 1 Pint can, 8.2% ABV. Bottled date 5/25/17. Look: Pours a beautiful opaque gold, thin white head of foam, heavy lace. Smell: Intense piney aromas right away, but with a subtle sweetness that creeps up on you. Distinct notes of tangerine and grapefruit also clearly present. UPDATE: emergence of guava in the smell, not easily noticeable right away, but very apparent in the back of the nose. Amazing. Taste: Again, very hop forward but equally matched in flavor by an intensely bitter grapefruit balance that is unmistakable. Feel: Incredibly smooth and drinkable, I would never guess that the ABV clocked in at 8.2%. This beer is truly unique and incredible. It pours an amazing golden color and the smell is subtle but so potent. At first, with such an amazing look and smell, the mild flavors almost took me back! But after a few more sips and a bit of warmth, it really transformed. Can't get over how smooth this DIPA is, really remarkable. There's a reason Tree House stands tall among American craft breweries. Get it if you can!"
1247,359550,jzeilinger,"On tap at Zwanzig Z. A - Clear to slightly hazy dark gold color with thin, dense, creme colored lacing and light on the carbonation. S - Delicate vanilla, banana, sweet malt, and bourbon. T - Some sweet Begian malt, bourbon, vanilla, spice, some cherry presence, some clove + spice. Bourbon forward at first until you get several sips in and the palate adjusts. M - Some warming in the back of the throat, big medium body, prickly carbonation with light coagulation on the sides of the tongue. (Crazy sensation description but it really does.) O - I love the fact ZwanzigZ offers barrel aged beers year around. Will be getting a howler to take home."
1249,123949,RonaldTheriot,"Brickway Pils has a thick, stark-white head, a hazy, yellow-gold appearance, some bubbles, and a bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet, pale malt (think of cracker), and faint lemon. Taste is of sweet, pale malt (white bread), lemon, and mild, rounding bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium and just a tad grainy/gritty, and Brickway Pils finishes fairly crisp and a just a little sloppy. RJT"
1264,276550,Ciocanelu,"From can. Really hazy yellow color with off-white head. Aroma has some fruity hops, pineapple and a light alcohol note. Taste has sweet fruits, light astringent pineapple flavor and sweet citrus. Full bodied, medium carbonation."
1277,276550,kojevergas,B- / WORTHY
1282,276550,dar482,"The beer comes with a full on haze in a medium gold, orange juice in a glass. The aroma offers orange, mango, fresh citrus peel, doughy malts, . The flavor follows with creamy body, a sweetness of mango bubble gum, gum balls, onto almost lightly plasticy aftertaste, a rounded yeast bite that lingers on the tongue and back of the throat."
1289,97487,JMScowcroft,"Lawson's Finest Liquids - Maple Wheat Ale, poured into a UFO hefeweizen glass. Look - Pours a cloudy copper amber with a good sized foamy head that dissipates at a medium pace and retains some. Good lacing. Smell - Aroma is a decidedly rich pilsner aroma with some sour wheat. Notes of maple are quite subtle (unfortunately). Taste - Dry, crisp, and refreshing as hell. The brew redeems the lack of maple interplay here with a nice yeast blend and a good body with a little carbonated snap. Very subtle on maple again here but it turns out well anyway. Mouthfeel - Dry and more light bodied than medium. Zero booziness. Slightly sticky from the maple. Great drinkability. Overall - This wins in this niche sub category for its attention to detail and delicate balanced infusion of maple with wheat. Terrific brew."
1291,97487,MDDMD,"A-slightly hazy yellow color with a nice white head and decent lacing S-wheat, hint of banana, slight maple sweetness T-wheat, malt, slight banana, little spice and maple, mild bitterness in the finish F-medium body with moderate carbonation, crisp O-interesting wheat ale with some hints of hefe, but not as compelling and maple flavor not present as much as I would have expected"
1293,191226,chitoryu12,"Look: Hazy gold with a thick white head, like a wheat beer. Smell: Very strong artificial orange scent, like orange soda. I can't really make out anything else over it. Taste: At first it tastes like carbonated water flavored with artificial orange, like La Croix. A tiny bit of soapy malt comes in at the end, just enough to remind you that it's beer. Mouthfeel: Very thin and highly carbonated. Again, like carbonated water. Overall: While not really offensive, it's incredibly boring. It tastes less like beer and more like someone put a little bit of flavoring in a bottle of sparkling water."
1295,47604,mikesgroove,"hazy amber with a goodsize two inch plus head on the top, decent retention as it stayed around bitter citrus hops. Tones of grapefruit and tangerine dominated the brew. Not much room for anything else in there. A bit of sugar, orange peel, huge hoppy bitter bite right out of the gate, good dry finish. Lots of resiney grapefruit tones throughout, a touch of sugar trying to balance out the hops, but it was not really going anywhere. Huge hops, huge bitter, BIG IPA."
1309,156241,Marius,"On tap at CBC 2016 - day 2. Vanilla, farmhouse funk and hints of bourbon. An interesting beer."
1318,156241,Kurmaraja,"Believe this was aged in Angel's Envy barrels. An interesting idea - bourbon BA saison - but it doesn't come together. Tastes a bit flat (not as in undercarbed, as in not dynamic). Slightly soapy texture. Hope they fine tune because I'm a fan of non-traditional barrel treatments for saisons."
1326,97183,Phyl21ca,Bottle: Poured a hazy hay color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of hay notes with some light citrus notes with some rustic malt notes. Taste is a mix of hay flavours with some citrus notes and some rustic malt notes with light spicy yeast notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Interesting take on the style but citrus notes are slightly too pronounced.
1327,97183,katan,"500ml into a pint. Surprised there hasn't been a review of this yet A - Pours a fairly thick golden to golden brown color. Light head formation, off white. Little lacing. S - Primarily citrus on the nose, with a backdrop of some spiciness. Coriander comes to mind most, perhaps a little white pepper. T - Starts off lightly sweet, comes through with a clean two row maltiness. Mid-stream brings in the spiciness in the lead, coriander and some clove. Citrus is present, but in the background. Finishes with a yeast based fruitiness. M - A moderate body and a good amount of carbonation. Starts off sticky and then turns dry with the carbonation. Clean. O/D - A good and interesting saison. Not an extreme version of the style, i.e. more towards clean and quality flavors than the funkiness of a saison. A little bit filling, abv is reasonable."
1334,79167,BeerNinja007,"Purchased this 22oz bomber for $7.99 at Koozie's (formerly Smiley's) of Dover NH. No code. Served cold in a tulip. A: 3/4"" of frothy white head settles to dense bubbles, leaving a thick foamy meniscus and some dense whispy stuff crowding the middle. Brew is semi-hazy, orange/ light copper in color, a bit dark for the style. On the second pour (after a bit of warming), it generates a generous head with stronger retention, pretty nice, but still not up to par with a decent saison. S: A nice dose of yeast and light malt sweetness hits my nose before I'm done pouring. Closer inspection reveals a soft, smooth, creamy, sweet malty yeasty aroma. Its missing some of the bright , crisp, saline, belgian spice stuff typical for a saison. Smells plenty tasty, just not very typical for the style in my opinion. Mild hop character is of mixed florals and some very soft tropical/ citrus fruits. Tiny notes of vanilla and butter, a hint of cocoa powder even. Light caramel. T: Fairly thick malt flavors, almost like a lighter brown ale. Jeeeez, do they even know what a SAISON is?! Definitely NOT true to style. Gingerbread, brown sugar, tannins, soda cracker. Hints of cocoa. Slight diacetyl in the finish. Moderate lemongrass, herb, and generic bittering hop. After it airs and warms up a little bit, the heavier flavors seem to burn off a little. The hop bitterness develops and takes a more prominent role and the body feels a bit more crisp. making it maybe a tad bit more saison-y, but still not very close. M: Perhaps the only thing even remotely like a saison is the mouthfeel due to its robust carbonation. Other than that, still not dry or crisp (attenuated) enough, too sweet and thick for the style. The combo of high carbo and moderate brown body does not mix well. Finish is slightly sweet and oily, not crisp, clean, or dry. O: If I didn't know this was supposed to be a SAISON then I might actually like it. But the fact that this is so far outside of the supposed style has me really hung up and I don't know how to react. I opened the bottle expecting one thing and got something completely different. Listen... I really love a great saison, it's one of my favorite styles to sip, quaff, chug, and brew. So when this thing ends up in my glass and it's not what I was expecting, I had a pretty strong negative reaction. Now that I've had my chance to vent, I think I'm coming to terms with this beer for what it is. It's not much as a saison, but it's pretty good as a beer, so I'm going to split the difference and weigh both of those factors equally (rather than completely slam it for not being true to style."
1335,79167,TheManiacalOne,"On-tap 11/16/2012 at Doherty’s East Ave Irish Pub in Pawtucket, RI, served in a US tumbler pint glass. A: The beer is a light brown color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. S: The aroma is faint but contains Belgian yeast, caramelized malts, some spice, some fruit and a faint touch of hops. T: The taste starts out bready with mild flavors of Belgian yeast and a hearty malt character. Then some mild sweetness comes in from flavors of caramel and spices. The hops presence is mild but complementary and brings some balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky. O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
1337,79167,Etan,"22oz bottle from Valdieu2. Thanks! A: Pours a pretty dark orange with a nice spongy white head. S: Smooth, sweet pale malt and yeasty esters - vanilla, white cake definitely a bit of pineapple and marshmallow. T: Drier than the aroma - a little bit of sweetness from the esters, with a mild smoky, herbal note. M: Light-bodied with somewhat frothy carbonation. O: This was pleasant to drink. A bit mild, but the smoky herbal note (perhaps from the sage?) makes it a little interesting - reminds me of similar notes in some Fantome saisons."
1339,79167,Dope,"A: Pours a deep hazy orange with a large fluffy off-white head atop it. Fades slowly lacing a pretty nice patchwork of lacing behind. S: Very bright lemon, orange and some pineapple. Yeasty bread and some caramel. Hint of pepper and earthiness. T: Very earthy up front and throughout. Yeasty with lots of pepper. Light pineapple and citrus to finish it off. Lingering grass, earth and black pepper in the aftertaste. M: Medium bodied, a touch drying and chalky. O: I wasn't expecting much but this one is pretty good. Nice mix of light citrus with a heavy earthy and peppery punch."
1345,47604,azdback,"Poured into a Spaten tumbler. A bright, clear orange color. Swarms of large carbonation bubbles lead to a large three finger head that is sea foam white and the same in appearance. Lace seems to be very sticky at this time. Smell is kind of lemony, with some bread or yeast and rye spice. Taste is bitter of a yellow grapefruit, some sweetness too. There is just a bit of rye spice to this but not at all in the front. Mouth is crisp and the carbonation is round to spritzy. Body is delicate and the finish is average and dry. Overall I am a little confused by this one. I couldn't get a lot of rye in the taste. This is a must try if easily obtainable but don't go beating down the trading forums for this one. Thanks to nycwinter for the chance to try this one."
1346,47604,Florida9,"A: Clear amber - looks like watered down whiskey. Forms a small white head that has little retention and leaves just a minimal lacing. S: Smells of rye, toast, some peppery spice, grass and a bit of butter. T: Lots of caramel malt and butter mixed with just a bit of pine and citrus hops. Rye spice on the finish is overpowered by unpleasant diacetyl flavors. M: Medium bodied, but with a very ""round"" mouthfeel to it that is likely a byproduct of whatever is causing the diacetyl. Lower carbonation levels. Mild bitterness. O: Simply put, this is just not a very good beer: Very little rye or hop character with an overwhelming amount of off-flavors."
1349,47604,BirdsandHops,"A: Pours a slightly hazy copper with two fingers of beige head that fades into a frothy cap with no lacing. S: Some light and sweet citrus notes up front followed by dry pine and grassy aromas. T: Very dry pine flavors dominate with some slight grassy notes. The finish is moderately bitter with some resin notes as well. M: Medium body with sudsy carbonation, this beer feels about as dry as it tastes. O: An alright IPA overall, though nothing special. It's a super dry IPA, though it'd be nice to have more depth of flavor and aroma."
1354,47604,mactrail,"Lovely dark amber in the tulip glass. Nice foam and pleasing carbonation in the mouth. Modest aroma of browned barley with some bread. Medium body with a rich, spicy flavor. Just the right amount of rye to give it that sharp grainy taste with a touch of perfume. Hops provide a fairly bitter backdrop. Like an IPA but restrained enough to make the hops a deep part of the flavor profile without stealing the show. Resiny taste along with the browned biscuits and spicy tang. Nice malty flavor provides good balance. Compares favorably with the tasty Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye, I think. From the 22 oz bottle."
1355,47604,Seanibus,"An adequate if not distinguished Rye beer. Pours a clear amber with a decent head. The aroma is sharp and toasty. The flavor is extremely sharp, dry, and toasty, with that characteristic mouthpuckering rye edge, but without the countervailing malt sweetness that distinguishes a great rye beer. The final effect is astringent and bitter. This beer takes the rye thing too far and too seriously."
1357,47604,inlimbo77,"22oz bomber bottle poured into a DFH snifter. No bottle date is located on the bottle from what I can see. A: Pours a really pretty orange color. Crystal clear look to it. Half finger of bright white head. Good amount of carbonation from the looks of it. Off the bottom of the DFH glass it's just rolling up. Not getting tons of lacing. S: I get some of those fruit and citrus hop notes, over ripe peach and mango. But then I get the grain bill notes. Sweet maltiness. T: I will start with this, I am sick and my taste buds are a little off. I do get some spicy notes on the tip of the tongue from the rye. You get those hops in the middle of the mouth. Nice balance of the spicy grains and the fruity hops. Also this is a very easy drinking beer. The lower ABV is nice. M: Medium bodied like most IPAs in recent memory. O: I like this one. It's a nicely balanced beer. Like the rye spicy marrying the fruity hops they used. Thumbs up."
1360,47604,TouchOfEvil,"22 oz. bottle poured into a Pint Glass A: Beautiful Deep Golden / Orange/ Red in color with a huge white head and some sticky lacing. S: Citrus hop aroma with some spice and caramel malt. T: Large, but not overpowering hop presence up front & nice spiciness from the rye. M: Medium body and the carbonation is spot on. It leaves a slight velvety coat on the palate. The finish is bit dry with just a little bitterness, but very nice. O: One of the first beers I had from Bootleggers and a great Rye IPA that I keep stocked in the fridge. Audio for this review: Guns N' Roses - Appetite for Destruction"
1364,47604,HalfFull,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, showing a deep golden color with a bit of orange/amber hue with a touch of haze. Sports a sturdy inch of foam which offers good retention and lacing. Light hop nose with citrus and a bit of spice. Touch of caramel as well. Rather clean and almost lager like in stillness with an almost additive quality to it. With warming the additive quality disappears and an earthy funkiness arises and adding more depth. Somewhat coarse on the palate likely given the rye component, otherwise showing the same citrus and caramel of the aroma. Offers an odd floral component that seems to come and go. Still a bit too malty with respect to hop flavors and rather reminiscent of an English IPA. Decent and smooth feel yet without the texture I would expect from a Rye IPA. Easy drinking and unotrusive with a flash of orange citrus and a light to moderate bitterness on the finish."
1366,47604,rtaps,"pours amber in color with about a finger and a half white frothy head. medium retention leaving spotty lacing around the glass citrus hop aroma and some spice from the rye, and a little florally. has a nice hoppy notes not over powering but definitely there. rye spice hints of fruit. light bodied med-high carbonation leaving the mouth nice and watery. overall this beer was exactly what a expected. enjoyable, and i like how the hops and spice was blended."

L- Thick soapy white colored head,with good retention and sticky lacing.After the head fades away,it leaves thick fluffy patching.Deep hazy straw / yellow colored body,with low clarity and only distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,and heavy amount of sediment. S- On the nose I get sweet orange juice,fresh peaches,papaya,mango,and pineapple fruit notes.Trace elements of bitter pine hops,and bright biscuit malts.This is a very hop forward beer,mostly consisting of tropical fruits. T- The palate follows the nose with orange juice,papaya,fresh peaches,mango,and pineapple from the beginning till the end.The palate finishes off with slight flavors of bitter pine that lingers with a sweet biscuit malt balance.This is one of those ""juice bomb"" IPA's I have been patiently waiting to try.It did not disappoint,at all.

1417,209594,adrianholt,"Had on tap at City Winery where the wine barrels come from. No doubt one of the best wits I've ever had. This is their standard Southern Wit aged in red Cab wine barrels. The aging def helps add a very nice tart and funky complex character. Dark straw color, tart smell, great taste. The wine character mellows out the Belgium yeast in a good way. Would definitely seek out again. TN Brew Works - Please bottle this stuff. A four pack would definitely sell for the same price as the standard 6 pack of Souther Wit."
1420,191226,BigJimmy02919,"The absolute worst beer to have ever crossed my pallet. Its look was even more orange and artificial than I expected from a blood orange beer. The smell was somewhat acrid and I wouldn't recommend inhaling deeply if you value your sinuses. The flavor confirmed my assessment of the smell and brought to mind the smell of opening the cupboard below the kitchen sink where the cleaning products are stored. It was gassy and its feel in the mouth was distinctly soapy, reminding me of having my mouth washed out with lifeboy for cussing when I was a kid. Others have compared this beer to Lysol. They were being kind in their assessment of smell, texture and taste. Hands down the worst beer I have ever had. As I said said to the server who brought this beer to me: ""take the bad beer away!"""
1422,191226,jcarlosv,"Did not care for the taste, very fruity taste. Taste more like orange juice with a touch of alcohol."
1423,191226,woodychandler,"This one is a real curiosity for me. Note that it does not identify itself as anything other than a ""Blood Orange Belgian Style Ale"". It is not a form of IPA, nor does it say which Belgian style that it is adhering to. These are the sorts of thoughts that occur on New Beer Sunday (Week 672) as I continue my brewery horizontal with Shipyard B.C. From the bottle: ""Florida brewed""; ""Belgian style ale brewed with coriander, orange peel, and natural flavors added"". I knew that it was going to be another screwed-up screw-top cap but I hated to deprive myself of the opportunity to Pop! the cap. Once it had been prised off, I began a slow, gentle pour into the awaiting glass, followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This action produced two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was solid Gold (SRM = 5) with NE-quality clarity, like sunshine in my glass, causing The Gelt Gang to come running in from my living room for a taste. Nose was unquestionably orange, but with a peppery spiciness. I was put in mind of a childhood activity book that showed me how to make a pirate hat out of folded newspaper and an air freshener out of cloves & an orange. This beer's smell reminded me of that early version of potpourri. Sweet, citrusy, but with a spiciness. Mmm. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I have been noticing this in all of their beers thus far. Is it something about the water that they are using at their brewery? The taste was kind of odd, like a cross between an orange lollipop and orange perfume. It was quite sweet and I was not getting the spiciness in the mouth the way that I had on the nose. Finish remained sweet and perfume-y & I just was not digging it. I liked the concept, but its execution was sub-par. YMMV."
1426,191226,jjamadorphd,"Shipyard is just one of those brewers I keep on trying and after I have another different offering I then keep on asking myself, 'Why?'. This particular brew is neither bloody or orange to the eyes, it is however a very clear and lightly orange-tinged brew with no head at all. The smell unique to an extent - it reminded me of an orange soda but with a hoppy tingle to my nose. The feel was mostly crisp, lightly water, but was the sessionable kind of feel - easy to pound. What I was perplexed with mostly was the taste. There was some of that orange soda character to it, there was some malty background, and the hops were mixed in as well, all of it, making for a simply weird brew. Not a particularly bad beer, but not the best the offer by a long shot. Though I think I would enjoy these on a hot summer day rather than having some calming beers at night."
1427,191226,Try-em-all,Good Summer ale not too overpowering citrusy taste is there but not too strong like to finger head cloudy and the pour smooth going down a real winner.

Aroma: dank with citrus Flavor: lightly funky, yeasty and fruity with sweet, tart and bitter aspects. Feel: light bodied, too light, but well carbonated. Overall: not bad but a disappointing."

Slight fruity aftertaste Feel- Light-Medium bodied to be expected. Overall- Bad. Overwhelming floral nose and taste is not good. Get another beer.
1442,253926,biboergosum,"473ml can - nothing in the way of info on the label as to how the word 'Bourbon' got into this one's name. This beer pours a clear, medium magenta colour, with three chubby fingers of puffy, rocky, and mildly fizzy pink head, which leaves some decent layered alien script lace around the glass as it rather lazily subsides. It smells of juicy blackberries, some musky florals, grainy and bready caramel malt, ethereal generic woody notes, a hint of wan yeastiness, and very, very subtle earthy, leafy, and musty hop bitters. The taste is gritty and grainy cereal malt, some blackberry and raspberry fruitiness, vanilla extract, a still pretty ephemeral woodiness, faint estery yeast, and more well-understated leafy, musty, and floral green hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly active in its palate-pinging frothiness, the body a solid middleweight, and mostly smooth, with just a hint of fruity tartness maybe not playing all that well with the proverbial neighbourhood kids here. It finishes off-dry, that floral berry essence predominating. Overall - yeah, if it didn't say 'Bourbon' on the label, I would not have even noticed the minuscule amount that is present in this offering. Add to that the meek 5.3% ABV, and things don't quite make sense, other than the heady dose of dark fruity character that saves this particular 'Wild Thing' in the end."
1443,47604,ikats,"Pours clear, light orange in color with a slightly off-white head. Very aromatic. Mostly citrus notes (grapefruit). Maybe some pine notes. Can't say that I smell any rye or malty notes in general. Taste is not particularly balanced. The malty base seems more pronounced than it would be in a regular IPA (not sure if that's effect of rye). Hops are very bitter from the moment they touch your mouth all through the aftertaste. There is a bit of dryness (although there is some sweetness on the lips as well from malts). It's about medium light body. Fairly drinkable. I am not sure if this beer will become my favorite (let's be honest, it is not anywhere close to the top of my list), but it is not regrettable. I'm enjoying tasting it at the moment."
1444,47604,Satchboogie,"22oz bottle poured into a tall tulip glass (Thanks vitese). A: Pours copper, fairly clear, with nearly 3 fingers of a tight, off-white head. Good retention, leaves decent lacing. S: Soft floral and citrus hops, spicy rye, caramel, smells bready. Lots of hop flavor, but not overly aggressive like many. T: Big, but soft hop presence up front with lots of flowers and citrus. There's not really any bitterness or 'kick', nor is it overly orange or grapefruit. Big bread notes with plenty of rye and spiciness. A little caramel, though it cleans out in the finish. M: Medium to slightly light body, moderate to slightly high (perfect) carbonation. Fairly smooth, very nice crisp and clean finish. Fairly chewy. Finish is fairly dry with just a little bitterness. O: Normally I would be looking for a bigger bite from the hops (more bitterness, more aggressive). Thinking of this as a rye beer though, I really like it. Gentle and flavorful hop presence that is the perfect compliment to the rye spiciness and hearty malts. Just the right touch of caramel to add richness without taking away the dry, clean and crisp finish. Tasty and refreshing and absolutely no astringency or alcohol presence. A tough one to rate, probably not an A- strictly as an IPA, but overall, I enjoyed this as much as a any beer I've given an A-..."
1445,47604,MrVonzipper,"Clear amber color with a frothy 2 finger slightly off white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Nose is not what I expected. Quite lacking especially in the hop department. Slight spicy leathery notes with a little pale malt. The flavor is a perfect representation of the name minus it saying IPA on the bottle. Again lacking a bit of a hop characteristic. But everything else is great. Nice spicy and earthy rye notes with mild fruit and a touch of citrus. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a mild zesty spiciness, crisp with medium carbonation. Overall it's a nice very drinkable beer. Lacking in hop notes and characteristics for an IPA, but good. They need bottle dates to determine if that's the reason for the lack of hops. I do recommend this for the nice rye spiciness and earthiness that is really nice."
1446,47604,jrnyc,"I had this one in a 22oz bomber. I got two 16 oz cans as an EXTRA from jimmy2282, thanks, what a great surprise!! Cans dated 8/1/2011. A - Lighter appearance then some other Rye IPAs, small head. S - Nothing significant about the smell. T - This one is OK, nothing I would spit out, but nothing extraordinary about it. Less taste then others of this style. M - Medium body O - Ehh, not bad, not great though. I wouldn't spit it out, but I wouldn't seek this one out, but would certainly drink it if other choices were limited."
1447,47604,FosterJM,"808th Review on BA Draft to Pint 12oz @Concourse Bowling, Fullerton, CA App- A nice darker orange out of the tap. Had a pretty minimal one finger head. Didn’t cling or stick like I was hoping it would. I think glasses were still a bit too cold. When I had this one out of the bottle, it was a heck of a lot different. Smell- A very nice smelling IPA. A lot of Rye comes through at 1st and is backed by a little bit of an earthy hop note and even a soft malt on the back. Not overly assertive with its aromatics, but enough to now its a big Rye beer. Taste- This was one of the more Rye forward beers I have had, right up there with Hop Rod Rye. This was very balanced with a lot of Rye being intermixed with a juicy hop and a little touch of malt on the other side. Forms a nice triangle of flavors. A little dry but that’s okay. Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation. A bit dry on the finish. A nice mixture of the rye and citrus. Drink- I'm becoming a fan of the Rye beers and I didn’t appreciate this one when I 1st had it. This was a nice beer to hang with and not have to worry about too much ABV or too much boldness. Smooth, subtle and a good beer."
1448,47604,roodie,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into my Duvel tulip. Thanks to cardinal79 for sending me this awesome extra! A: pours a amber/gold brown with 3 fingers of pillowy white head, lots of lacing remains. S: smells of grassy hops and sweet malts, the rye smell reminds me of a pastrami sandwich sans pastrami T: very pleasant hoppy bitterness, muted by the malts, moderately sweet and caramelly, but the star is the rye taste adding a bitter breadiness to the flavor profile M: very smooth, malts and hops mellow each other with a perfect velvety coat on my palate O: a great brew, haven't had it on tap but plan to next time I'm in OC."
1449,47604,pmarlowe,"No bottle date. Tulip glass. Pours a deep clear golden color with a finger of head, tiny bubbles. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells mostly like rye bread with an undercurrent of tangerine, prominent caramel and sugary malt. Taste is kind of grainy/bready with maybe a little orange/tangerine citrus, and again a hefty dose of caramel malt, finishing moderately bitter. Medium bodied and medium-light carbonation. Overall, this was a little disappointing in its lack of any sort of hop character. It's all malt and rye. I'd pass on this again."
1450,47604,kzoobrew,"Pours a clear, bright orange body. A four finger, eggshell colored head rests atop. The fluffy head works its way back slowly. Fairly solid sheet of lacing blankets the glass. This is a great looking beer, I am not saying it is perfect but they do not get much better. The nose displays an impressive amount of balance. Sweet citrusy hop aroma comes across first. There is a pleasant malt base sitting right behind. Spicy rye and warm breadiness pair well with the hops. There is not a great deal of crystal malt coming through in the nose, I appreciate that. Soft grassy hops linger in the back. I have sat on this bottle for a little bit, while it is certainly with in the appropriate time from for enjoying, I feel the hops may have died down slightly. The aroma is very pleasant none the less. The flavor is very similar to the characteristics picked up in the nose with one huge difference, the rye. The rye simply was a complimentary aroma but is a dominant flavor. I cannot recall a Rye IPA with this much rye presence. The citrus hop flavor is noted upfront along side the rye. The earthy spiciness of the rye works well in combination with the citrusy hops. The bitterness from the hops is hard to judge, the almost astringent quality of the rye can mask it a bit. On my palate I would say the bitterness is a bit lower allowing the rye to provide the bite. Behind the rye the bready malt flavor completes the flavor profile. This is not a terribly complex beer, with many flavor transitions, but the flavors work very well together. Medium bodied beer, the carbonation is slightly lower than what I would desire. The finish is a touch above dry. The mouthfeel is the low point for this beer. While not bad by any means, it just does not leave me as impressed as the other attributes. Rustic Rye is a heck of a beer. I am really digging the assertiveness of the rye. The flavor combination works very well. A very drinkable beer. Big thanks to FosterJM for the bottle."
1451,47604,HopHead84,"8/21/2011 A: Dark gold with a big frothy white head and lots of lacing on the pint glass. S: Floral notes with orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Malt is bready, with rye and caramel. T: Bread and caramel with a little rye. Notes of orange blend with tangerine, attempting to combat the malt. Alcohol is well hidden. Bitterness is at a moderate level. M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall: A good IPA, though maltier than desirable."
1452,47604,Vanlingleipa,"This is a nice, solid brew that I would hand to someone new to craft beer. Appearance: Orange-brown with a fair amount of white head that disappears after a few minutes. Aroma: Distinct, but not overwhelming scent of hops Taste: This is not an overwhelming beer - The rye complements the hops well - They are both present at first taste with the hops coming out stronger. The rye lasts longer, hanging on to the finish as the taste fades. There's almost a smoothness to this beer, which is unusual for a hopsy beverage. I'd bring this one to a house full of bud drinkers as an introduction to craft beer - it won't overwhelm anyone, but still has a distinctive taste, scent and body. As for myself, I prefer bolder flavors."
1453,47604,Buttermaker,"I generally don't like the flavor of rye, but in beer I find it's a nice compliment to the hops. It works especially well in an IPA where rye's natural astringency can't overpower the beer. This one's got a rich nose that offers plenty of caramel malt and cascade hops. I can't smell the rye. I can definitely taste it though. It adds a little spice to an otherwise solid IPA. The Rye flavor melds nicely into the hops on the finish. Solid effort. Recommended music pairing: Stephen Malkmus - Pig Lib"
1454,47604,Bendurgin,Thanks for this one from Randy. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a burnt orange color with a thing layer of foam. Big rye aroma with a little bit of fruity and piney hops rounding this one out. Hints of caramel linger. Bitter hops start to finish here with a pretty good rye flavor. Slight fruity notes in the flavor but this has a big bitter hop finish. Light body with somewhat sharp carbonation. Pretty enjoyable IPA here. I love rye so this one is right up my alley!
1455,47604,DarthKostrizer,Look: Brownish orange with 1 inch head and great retention and some spotty lace also had some floaters Smell: Very strong wheat and rye notes with some citrus and pine Taste: Very light wheat and rye notes and piney hops are the big flavors. Citrus fruits as well are present. AS the beer warms the piney hops become a bit overpowering Mouthfeel: Light body high carbonation and a dry finish it leaves the palate really dry that you need to keep drinking this. Is it that bad??? Overall: I really enjoyed this beer and will consume several more in the coming months. The is a great summer beer especially on these hot california nights. Good flavor profile and just an overall good beer
1456,47604,AgentZero,"A - Burnt umber color with an off-white head that had moderate retention and stick. S - Fairly mild. Not a particularly hoppy IPA, although granted it is a single as opposed to double. There's some citrus/grapefruit notes. Some caramelized rye on the backbone. It smells nice, but fairly innocuous. T - Easy drinking. Some more hops, mostly grapefruit in nature. The rye is nicely present, but not overpowering. Nothing in this beer is overpowering, just smooth, easy to drink. M - Moderate body and carbonation and finishes on the dry side. O - Not a bad beer, can get it down easily enough, but there isn't a ton special that is going on here."
1457,47604,Klym,"Poured into a stone nonic. A: Pours a difficult mix of brown, orange, red and yellow with different colors and shades all over the place depending on how the light hits. Lacing just covers the wall of the glass with foam. Nice. S: Tangerine, mango, apple, cherry, hops and yeast in the nose. The fruitiness and hoppiness really balance well in the nose, which I think is a nice change from the one-sided dominance of so many IPAs. T: Taste is more bitter than I expected. I got some yeasty floaties in my glass and I'm a little bit worried that's affecting the taste. Honestly, much more hop bite, grain and yeast in the taste than was present in the smell. Fruits are more subtle and swirl around the strong presence of the aforementioned flavors offering good support, but I wish the fruitiness was a little less shy. There's kind of a hollow taste gap in the middle which is strange to me. M: Watching the beer pour made it seem like it had an almost syrup like viscosity and you can appreciate the slick thickness in the mouth as well. Really a silky feeling though that does well by me. Carbonation is felt more in the rest in the mouth than in the tongue. O: I drank this on the recommendation of Cavery and he had a glass from this same bottle with me. He says there seems to be something strange about this bottle in relation to the last time he tried it so I leave my review here open to the possibility that the yeast I accidentally poured or some other bottle issue isn't giving me the full experience here. That said, the beer I just had is good, interesting, but seems to have a strong need to be tweaked. Flavor of fruits needs to be upped, hops/yeast toned down, and progression of the tastes needs to be reworked a bit. I think there are some raw materials of greatness in this beer but at the moment, only the raw materials."
1458,47604,OWSLEY069,"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, dry rye and a hint of hops. In the taste, a small hop and a small rye fruitiness. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry green apple skin in the aftertaste. A nice rye presence, but small hop than expected."
1459,47604,HuskyinPDX,"0% 22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. A - Pours a dark Carmel-orange in color with a quick fading light tan head. Some lacing left on the glass. S - Slight maltiness, but that is it. T - Hoppy, but not piney. Some Carmel, but not sweet, muted. D - Medium carbonation. O - Interesting flavors, but I enjoyed it."
1462,253926,Bunman3,"This is a super tasty beer. It looks great in the glass, gives you lots of berries on the nose, and finishes nicely on the palate. The bourbon is barely discernible, but that is a wee problem when you consider the overall package. Lovely summer drinking indeed!"
1473,291936,FLima,"Amber color with a thick off-white head with good retention and leaving laces. Malty aroma with notes of caramel and mild grapefruit citrusy. Dry hop is hidden in its malty base. Flavor with notes of grapefruit, pine, toasted and caramel malts, spices and pineapple core. Dry and bitter aftertaste. 53 IBUs sounds right. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 7,5% is hidden in its malty base. Traditional American IPA still with a mild British accent probably given its malty base and focus on grapefruit. Interesting pricing."
1474,265102,StonedTrippin,"calling this a blonde ale is a stretch, or at least it sets up some misleading expectations, this is hazy and pretty orange colored, some sediment in it, not what i was expecting from the style, but a beer my gal and i enjoyed quite well last night. it has a citrus fruitiness to it, a fuller malt body, some starchiness, a floral aspect, and a yeast strain with really interesting flavor, estery, not the conventional profile for a blonde ale, thats for sure. orange peel, under ripe strawberry, light honey, and just a dash of hop bitterness. this would be heavy to me without such high carbonation, which kind of saves it for me in terms of texture. nowhere near as light as i would like in a blonde ale, but when i accept it as something else, unique to itself, then i like it more. good for the early fall, a little more substantial and with some unique flavors happening, fruity and interesting, even if it is a little amateurish. overall a fun glass of beer for a little something different, but dont come in expecting the standard blonde ale."
1480,178983,Harrison8,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Aroma boasts notes of light coffee, with heavier notes of toasted and nutted malts. Despite a dark aroma, it doesn't come across as strong, or like something that would take willpower to consume. Flavor profile is the same toasted and nutted malts, with coffee appearing a bit stronger. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with a medium thickness. Overall, a very smooth stout with pleasant notes of coffee. Coffee doesn't dominate this beer, allowing the oatmeal stout to resonate well. Draft. Reviewed from notes."
1482,178983,Gatch,Just a typical stout. Enjoyable and roasty but nothing mind-blowing. Also not great to pair with 90-degree temperatures but I wasn’t feeling an IPA. A solid choice if you’re feeling a coffee oatmeal stout.
1492,178983,StonedTrippin,"aside from its overall quality, nothing about this beer is particularly striking on its own. the coffee is bold in here, fresh and yummy, but not overly unique or anything. meanwhile, the malt bill is about right for a good stout of this stature, but there is nothing about it that is really distinguishing. the yeast is almost irrelevant here, and there isnt any weird adjunct beyond the coffee to make the freaks freak out. its almost understated from top to bottom, no frills at all, and just a very well made stout with coffee, with a rich starchy oaty body, some slight residual sweetness, and a wonderful creamy texture that opposes the coffee sharpness at the right instances without ever shucking the mellow jive here. more coffee would be cool for the flavor, but its neat how low acid it is, and how the beer seems light but the roast seems heavy. drinkable for what it is, but somewhat linear on the whole. i liked this apparently more than others, and im not sure why. something about this is honest and endearing, and i feel like i owe it respect..."
1499,178983,mothman,Beige head. Dark brown color. Big coffee and roast up front. Chocolate and vanilla. Caramel. Light sweetness. Smooth and creamy. Easy to drink. Ends with a little roast. Very nice coffee offering.
1501,178983,breadwinner,"Starts out well enough, a nice rocky tan head atop and a nose of, well, coffee. Probably not the best coffee nose ever, but not particularly stale or acrid or any of the other adjectives that come to mind in a bad coffee stout. On the palate, though, this one falls off a little. I sometimes think folks demand too much body from stouts, but this one -- particularly at almost 7% ABV -- is indeed lacking, and it serves to amplify a sort of coffee-water vibe. It's straight ahead, one note, roast and a pot o' coffee stuff. Overall, it ain't bad. It'll scratch your coffee-laced beer itch, but this is more diner-level than your favorite local roastery."
1505,47604,Cavery,"Bottle shared with SundaySour, poured into Stone Nonic glass. poured carefully, leaving yeast at the bottom of the bottle. A: Early morning red sunlight with a massive 3 finger head. The head fluffs over the body like some fancy soap in a scented bathtub. If Sundaysour pays too much attention to this visual, she'll remind me that I'm not romantic enough. An unusual redness, but what a strong head! S: Smells of fresh cut leather, tropical fruits, and persimmons. Really nice enticing nose. Sweet bread malt backbone accentuates tropical fruits in favor of mango, and gradually pulls the senses away from citrus. A bit conflicted, but good nonetheless. T: Very light tangerine citrus zing, mango middle, and french bread crust malt. Pleasantly light grainy bittering that is chased by a lemongrass note. A seed-like linger in favor of sesame makes for a fantastic aftertaste. An extremely crushable Rye IPA. Finish of lighter rustic breads. M: Modest carbonation that disguises a medium/heavy body for the style. This really adds to the bready dimension of the malt. I feel like I have a crunchy artisanal bread in my mouth. Quite nice and distinct, but may contribute to the flavor being a bit monotone. O: This beer is on the verge of greatness, but for right now it can settle solidly on the side of very-goodness. I think with a bit of refining this could give the Alpine IPAs a run for their money. This beer certainly has some ""rough"" edges, but they aren't necessarily negative. There is a really ""raw"" ingredient element to this beer that I appreciate, but I would urge bootleggers to dig deeper. They have something really good here that could be great. It could use maybe a bit stronger flavor (imperial anyone?) and perhaps some more discernable flavor transitions. However, this beer is aptly named. In the end this is a deliciously ""rustic"" rye offering."
1506,47604,Urbancaver,Pours a hazy orwngish brown. A nice amount of light tan head. Very frothy and nice. Smells sweet with a touch of rye spice. Some pine on the nose as well. Tastes sweet and well balanced the rye spice is a bit underwhelming and the hops are not very prominent but overall a fairly solid brew
1507,47604,srandycarter,"A - Fairly clear honey, near white head, stays for some time. Cling lace pretty evident. S - Light smell, malt and spice. T - Rye is nice, mixed with sweet malt. M - Nice mix between the sweet and the grainier, spicy rye. D - Very easy to drink. I think I like this one."
1508,47604,vande,"Got a few bottles form a co-worker whose brother flew out this way to visit..with some spare room in the luggage :) A ~ Amber, bit cloudiness...but a nice glow to it S ~ citrus hops & rye blend....a bit of malts mixed in with a waft of orange/coriander? T ~ pretty good...reminded me of Cane & Ebel and Founders RyePA...tasty...essentailly a blend of what one smells M ~ medium to thin bodied beer that allows the carbonate to roll down the palate.. O ~ I thought it was a pretty good Rye P. A. Definitely enjoyed their Knuckle Sandwich more, but nice to try their other offerings none the less."
1509,47604,Arbitrator,"Chilled bottle into a glass. A: Pours a hazy chestnut-amber body with a short-lived off-white head. Lacing is light and the primary remnant of head is a medium collar on the beer. S: Vibrant citrus and floral hops that combine to remind me of overripe mango. It's vaguely earthy, as well. No rye in the nose that I can pick up, but there is a cereal note. Not all that pungent, definitely not a standout. T: Rye is a little more pronounced in the taste, though it's not spicy; it contributes a robust graininess that counteracts the [dominant] earthy hops. Mild taste of citrus, but nothing as vibrant as the nose suggested. Also a little buttery (??!?) by the end -- I haven't tasted this in an IPA in a long time. M: Medium-bodied, with good carbonation. Fairly smooth despite the rye, which I usually expect to contribute a bite. O: It's drinkable, but forgettable. Still not feeling the Bootlegger's love yet..."
1510,47604,wino47,Hazy appearance with nice carbonation and a pleasant aroma of citrus and bready notes. The body is a little light with the flavor coming across a little on the watery side. This definitely didn't have much of the rye character I expected and was a little too thin compared to others in the style. Not something I would seek out again.
1511,47604,Retsinis,"Poured from a 22oz bomber bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. A: The beer pours a cloudy golden orange, with a light brown tinge hue. A solid inch head rose, leaving some spotty lacing. S: Scents of grapefruit, and mild caramel, some dry lemon, citrus, very mild rye, and hop spice. T: Mixture of tropical hops, followed by carmel sweetness, with a bitter dry finish. It's a bit between a light Imperial IPA with this malt character, and a lighter hops than an IPA. The Rye notes could be stepped up too imho. M: medium mouth, dry finish. Malt smooths it out a bit, but it also has some grit to it. O: Decent, but not stellar. It has potential, so some recipe tweaking and it could be a real winner."
1512,47604,largadeer,"Bottle from K&L RWC. No freshness date. The color is a brownish-gold, fairly hazy with a lower-moderate level of carbonation that produces about an inch of head. The nose is...pretty bland, actually. I was expecting a lot more from this, having had some great IPAs from Bootleggers. There's a citrusy, grapefruit-like hop presence, but it's mild. I can't say that I get much rye. A bit of cereal sweetness. Not a bad aroma by any means, just boring. There's a bolder hop character on the palate, leaning in the grapefruit direction with a little bit of an herbal/earthy twang. Rye has a moderate presence, lending some drying earthiness to an otherwise bready, moderately sweet malt base. As I work my way through the bottle, I start to pick up mild diacetyl. The finish is pretty grainy and bitter; the beer feels a bit thin until it warms up, and then the caramel malt backbone becomes more evident. Overall, there's nothing horribly wrong with this beer, it's just very run-of-the-mill. Easy enough to drink, but completely forgettable. It's probably more of a B- than C+, but I can't justify bumping up my scores any more than this. Pass on this one and give their SoCo IPA a try."
1513,47604,Trilogy31,"Pours an amber brown with nice clarity and a fluffy cap that leaves thick lacing. Nose has some spicy bready notes, earthy forest, without much else. Taste is easy drinking and bittered nicely yet a touch simplistic. Dry rye bread, a touch of slightly sweet caramel, and again not much else. Decent and easy drinking but nothing out of the ordinary."
1520,47604,DoktorZee,"Poured from a 22oz bottle without a best before date into a schooner. A – Solid amber color and very slightly cloudy, fluffy white head that resolved after a couple minutes leaving a moderate amount of lacing. S – Strong citrus hops on the nose; really nice and cutting. So strong that I couldn’t get anything else. T – Best way I could think of to describe the taste as remarkably even and bitter. The citrus hops was present from the first part of the sip and all the way through. It was supported by some very mild bready malts, but the hops were absolutely center stage. M – This had a lighter body than its color and pedigree would have suggested. It was only mildly carbonated with no booziness. D – Very drinkable, but also a bit unidimensional; lacked character beyond the hops to really drive me to drink more than one. A decent IPA but not really remarkable in any dimension other than the solidity of its hops!"
1521,47604,ramseye4,"A=A light golden color with faint amber hues. One finger head with subpar retention and lacing. S=Subdued caramel malt and rye. Not strong at all, definitely the low point of this beer. The rye is subdued but adds a nice touch. T=Prominent caramel malt and subdued rye, some hop bitterness comes out in the aftertaste. Very drinkable, but not outstanding. M=The high point of the beer. Very high carbonation that feels great rolling across the tongue. Medium body. O=I'm glad I got to try this, but it doesn't hold a candle to Hop Rod Rye. Still, I would definitely have it again."
1522,47604,ottovon,"A: a nice coppery-orange color with a fluffy, white head. leaves lacing down the glass. S: i get caramel malts, bread, some citrusy hops and orange peel. there is a bit of peppery spiciness in the nose as well. T: caramel malt, citrus hops, and some spiciness. i get orange and some straw in the flavor. finish bitter and semi-dry. M: it has a nice medium-thin body that sort of coats the tongue. a little resinous. D: this is a good beer, that i could drink more of."
1523,47604,orangesol,"I brought this to the Inaugural ""Imminent Liquidation Bottle Share"" Event. Bottle poured into a taster glass. A - Pours hazy orange with a nice cap of one and a half finger tall head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving light lacing down the glass. S - Plenty of rye, bready malt, grassy citric hops, and some dulled citric fruit. Pretty good, a bit faded tho. T - Very similar to the nose. Big dose of chewy malt, rye, and dulled citric hops. Finish is a mix of chewy grains and light hop bitterness. Not too bad, just nothing mind blowing. M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Overall chewy feel with most of it lingering throughout the finish. D - Decent stuff. I enjoy rye beers, even if this one is listed as an IPA, for what they are but I am just not a fan of the chewy feel that accompanies them. Overall this was pretty good but it really wasn't anything mind blowing."
1524,47604,Wowcoolman,"Rye IPA hopped with Citra, poured into a Tremens glass. The nose is pleasant; sweet and malty. The taste is hops and rye, but the combination doesn't quite come together creating a weird mix of flavors with the rye somewhat holding things together. A subtle honey sweetness comes at the finish. Interesting, but not on the level of Hop Rod or Lenny's RIPA."
1525,47604,jpmclaug,"Bottle into a pint glass. Got this on my birthday trip to SoCal at the brewery. A - amber body with a white head on top S - Light floral hop aroma mingles with some pale malts T - Spicy notes from the rye, a bit of a florally hop flavor, really well balanced, finishes with a hint of bitterness M - medium body, good amount of carbonation D - Drinks real easy. Almost like a APA rather than an IPA. This is a really enjoyable beer but nothing otherworldly. I'm glad I got to try it and would drink it again."
1526,47604,PeprSprYoFace,Been seeing this beer on shelves for a while now but never bought one. Now that I tried their Knuckle Sndwitch I've been trying more Bootleggars stuff. Pours a very nice orangy hazy yellow color. Very nice frothy head with very nice lacing. In the Aroma you really get the rye. Nice hoppy citrucy aroma complements the rye character. The flavor is great. Nice hoppy bite with the smoothness of the rye. It feels like it's missing something in the finish. Like a hop isn't biting my tongue enough. It hits the sides of your tongue but notthe center. Mouthfeel is good. Nice dryness with a good carb. Overall I could drink this often. If I see it on tap somewhere I'll get it for sure. It's a solid beer and I don't know why it only had a B rating on here. It's not the best ive had but it is solid.
1527,47604,mothman,"Pours 1/4 finger of beige head. Color is a burnt rustic orange. Aroma: Rye, grassy/floral hops. Some grapefruit citrus and bready maltys. Taste: Grapefruit citrus, floral grassy hops, rye, bready malts. Simple. Mouthfeel: Bitter and spiced. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends really, really dry. Overall, decent rpa, but a bit to dry for me. Somewhat drinkable."
1528,47604,tburus,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Appearance: A cloudy, light brown liquid with a nice, thick, two-finger, off-white head. Smell: Bright citrus hop aroma with a mellow rye sourness to it. Very relaxing fragrance. Taste: The initial hit is of hops, but quickly the sour rye flavor takes over. Going down the hops reappear in a tame bitterness. Mouthfeel: Definite IPA bitter mouthfeel. Not too bitter. Like most other aspects of this brew, it appears that the rye component is muting the more traditional IPA aspects. To be honest, I don't totally mind this, as I tend to enjoy rye beers and have yet to develop a great affinity for the more highly touted ""hopped up"" IPA's. Drinkability: Super easy drinkability. The muted hop character and low ABV make this a very appealing option. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this beer and am thankful to nicks6217 for throwing this in on a trade that we completed."
1529,47604,jrallen34,"Bottle poured into a perfect pint glass...Pours a medium gold with red and copper tones. Nice tope head, good retention and lacing...Light of aroma, of surprise, rye. A little caramel with a smidge of vomit on the end...The taste and feel are really light. Feel is annoyingly thin. The taste is light rye, not strong but incredibly easy to drink, a total palate cleanser."
1530,47604,thagr81us,"Served from tap into a sampler mason jar at the brewery. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. It maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat (rye perhaps?), and citrus hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hop, and slight bitter hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't bad, but this was not great. It was nicely balanced in flavor, but it just seemed to be lacking something... The rye/wheat taste perhaps??? It had a pretty good aroma though. Would definitely be happy to try this one again."
1533,276550,Greywulfken,"Collaboration with Cloudwater... 8% abv IIPA featuring Citra, Nelson, Cashmere, and Calypso hops, oats, spelt, and lactose... 4/14/17 canning... Looks like dirty grapefruit juice - muddied yellow-brown color, thoroughly opaque, big head of off-white foam leaving some lace trails down the glass... Herbal grapefruit and woodsy-grain impressions on the nose... big bitter pith, dry and tight, maybe edged with some dank funkiness on the tongue... Medium-light feel, gripping bitterness, moderate carbonation, lingering aftertaste of citrus and barnyard..."

1538,276550,cosmicevan,thanks again to davidsoul. canned 2 weeks ago to the day. really hazy yellow murk. nose dances on the line of tropical blast and bitter hops. easy to drink in gulps and the tropical pop leads in the taste. has a great body...unique and a nice collab. muddiness in the hop flavoring making it hard to pick out anything in particular but definitely feels like a bunch of competing hop flavors. still very tasty.
1544,276550,ProperGlassesNeeded,"L- opaque-hop ponder water-cheap canned pineapple juice- but a sign of great things to come S - fantastic hoppy, boozy (for a hop bomb, smells boozier than it tastes, heavenly liquid, resin-y T- Its delicious, tropical but less tropical than most hop bombs, its heavy on sweet hops balanced resin, green yum F - feels like fruit juice O- try this soon. Great collaboration grade A"
1545,276550,mnj21655,"Pours a turbid pale orange in color with maybe a quarter inch of white head that quick fades to nothing; this strongly resembles grapefruit juice. Aroma is candied pineapple along with indistinct tropical and stone fruits, very appealing. Taste has the same candied pineapple as the aroma but adds some distinct mango, nectarine, and white grape notes with a lightly sweet finish. Medium+ body and low-moderate carbonation. Overall a great beer, very enjoyable, the whole is even greater than the sum of its parts."
1546,276550,mdfb79,"Pours a super hazy bright orange color. An insane amount of tropical fruits, mangos, pineapples, citrus hops, and fruity mats. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall one of their best; an amazing beer."
1548,123949,HoppyBastard,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, there is no ""best by"" date that I can find. APPEARANCE: pours a clear, golden color with one finger white head with excellent retention, it slowly dissipated until a thin unbroken layer of bubbles remained, there is significant lacing on the glass and higher than average carbonation. SMELL: cracker and sweet malt. TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet then the taste of crackers and finishes with a gentle hop kiss. PALATE: medium body and higher than average carbonation. OVERALL: this is a terrific pils because it is so wonderfully balanced, it would appeal to anyone who likes beer, this is the third beer I have had from this brewer and they were all wonderful, I would definitely buy this again and will be trying more from this brewer in the near future."
1550,123949,Boto,"Draught at Twin Peaks: Unfortunately served in a large highly iced mug. This one pours a lighter golden color. Aa fairly frothyhead that left some lacing. Somewhat lighter aroma. Pretty typical of a pils. The taste is decent. Some hop flavor, it could have used a bit more."
1551,123949,omahawk,"Update: Brickway’s marketing of one Pils and one Pilsner is quite confusing. From looking at their website, it appears they might have stopped making this Pilsner I reviewed back in 2015. It’s too bad because I enjoyed the 2015 version much more than what I had in 2017. The review I’m leaving here is for the “Pilsner” from 2015, which tastes more German than Czech. My original review was: The German Pilsner pours a nice clear golden color. Decent lacing, with German hop and pils malt nose. Very clean, solid example of a European pilsner. Will keep on hand all summer."
1556,123949,Yeags,Something about this beer leaves you wanting more!
1561,123949,BeerWithMike,"Sampling right now on 11/4/14 after bowling. From the Borgata Brewery right here in Omaha, Nebraska. Can chilled down to 36 dgrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled glass thumb-print stein. Pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a good 1-finger fizzy white head that settles down to mostly along the sides of the glass. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of grains mostly. Pretty much the same for the taste with lots of grain aftertaste as well, but not hoppy. Lighter to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation as seen with lots of bubbles rising up from the sides and bottom of the glass. Overall, it was a decent example of this brew style."
1568,47604,Anaz,"A- Hazy red orange, 2 fingers of white head with little lacing. S- Orange flower water and meyer zest with rye spiciness, and some herbal hop character. T- Very malty, a little sweet. Kind of like a rye bread with candied citrus zest. Not bad, but balanced in favor of the malt rather than being hop forward. Floral and herbaceous hop flavors marry well with the rye spice, and the lingering malt sweetness results in an almost neutral finish after being tempered by the hop bitterness, which makes this very easy to drink. The mouthfeel is very full, and a little syrupy and oily, but it's not cloying. The carbonation is low. This is a very drinkable rye IPA with good flavor, but not a lot of intensity. I'd really like it if it was a little drier, but, it's still a good beer and a good reason to support a local brewery."
1569,47604,AWolfAtTheDoor,"This is my first beer from Bootlegger's. Pours a hazy dark golden color. Lacing is pretty looking good so far. First smell was a blast of apple/cider. Upon stronger whiffs, I think it's the rye and/or yeast character playing tricks with me. Very different smelling than other rye beers I have had. Was not expecting this taste at all. I can only describe it as a creamy rye, with a hint of hop bitterness at the end. But this beer is all biscuit malt and rye. Medium mouthfeel. Slightly syrupy even. This is a nicely bodied beer. Very drinkable. It's smooth and tasty. Rye is one of my favorite ingredients. If I were grading this beer according to style, it would fall flat on it's face. Not even close to an IPA. However if you like rye, give it a shot."
1570,47604,Xul,"A: Pours a translucent golden with some amber highlights, capped by two fingers of foamy, off-white head. Retention is moderate as it slowly settles to about a half finger of head. S: Moderate citrus up front along with piney and earthiness, followed by pleasant spicy notes of rye. Toffee base is evident in the background, although aroma as a whole is a bit subdued. T: Hops are a bit muted up front with piney and earthy notes coming through. Rye comes through strong on the mid-palate before giving way to a burst of sweet caramel near the back end. M: Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation, feels a bit thin. D: Easily drinkable but doesn't quite live up to its potential. I'll certainly try it again as the beer has its merits, perhaps this had sat a bit too long."
1571,47604,kk73,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my glass. A - Pours a clear brunt orange with a modest white head that quickly disappeared into a white sheen and a white ring around my glass. Leaves a little lacing. S - Not getting much in the way of spicy rye(maybe I dont know what rye is supposed to smell like). Some faint floral hops combined with a slighty sweet malt backbone. T - Not much on the tongue either. A slight grapefruit bitterness that does not last long followed by some sweetness possibly from the malt. M - Light and crisp, maybe a touch watery. D - Not a bad beer, just not one I would purchase again. However this could be sessionable on a very hot and humid day. Very light and refreshing and very little alcohol detection."
1572,47604,Beerandraiderfan,"Picked this up while in Socal for BT (what a magical 48 hours), couldn't beat the price on this. Drank at the Utah State @ Nevada tailgate. Pours a light orange, very clear, good carbonation and average head, light hop aroma, sweetness, tempered. Taste, relatively smooth, lacking the rye spiciness you might expect, but decent hopping, light caramel flavor, still carries some of that sweetness throughout. Not a complex or strong rye beer at all. $3.49 a bomber, it was worth that."
1573,47604,klikger,"Bomber served in a Goose Island IPA tulip A - Medium to dark amber, large white head (shrinks down after a minute or two), and great lacing S - Floral hops, rye, and oranges T - Rye and lemony hops --&gt; bready rye and a little black pepper --&gt; a splash of grapefruit briefly finishes off this rye cocktail M - Medium-bodied and adequately carbonated. D - Inoffensive and pretty tasty. Not bad. This is a solid rye IPA - it's not too complex, but the tastes it possesses are pulled off nicely. Definitely worth a try if you like the style."
1574,47604,Gobzilla,"Poured a orangish brown with a half finger of head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. On the first whiff I was greeted by some citrusy qualities but had caramel malt presence with bready biscuit notes and faint hops in the background. The hops were a tad more potent on the palate with citrus and slight pine accents with lots of sweet caramel notes but no rye to be found. The brew was light to medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, malty, and slight hoppy finish. It drank really good and would probably be able to drink lots of this beer in one sitting making it a pretty sessionable brew."
1575,47604,koopa,22oz bomber received as an extra in a trade with a generous BA thanks! Appearance: Pours copper with honey folds. The crown is a 1 finger soapy white that displays moderate retention and lace. Smell: Rye and floral hops over a slightly toffee like malt. Taste: Same as the nose but more pungent. I'd give it a 3.8 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with active fine carbonation. Drinkability: Sessionable.
1576,47604,ZX6Chris,"A-Golden amber. Nice tight white head that settles on top. Slight lacing that settles quickly back into the glass. S-At first it smelled like a Jr. Pliny, but the aroma faded quickly. Now I'm getting a little wet cardboard. Definitely not good. T-Earthy, spicy hops, spicy and mildly sweet malts and there it is again, wet cardboard. M-like the head suggests this is a creamy beer, light, maybe a little undercarbed for the style. D-It was going well at first but that wet cardboard taste ruined it. I drank enough to finish my review and then I drain poured."
1577,47604,emmasdad,"Picked this one up at Holiday Wine Cellar on a recent trip to San Diego. Poured from the bomber a medium orange color with a huge rocky white head. Some citrusy hops on the nose, as well as a little caramel. On the palate, more of the same, but really no noticeable rye. Not bad, but kind of a disappointment considering the number of great west coast IPAs out there."
1578,123949,NikyP,"Had a pint of this on tap at the Magnolia Hotel in downtown Omaha. Brewery is just down the street. This one doesn't disappoint. Truly a pilsner. Extremely drinkable (or it could be effects of the long day's travels). I really like this beer. Clean, fresh tasting, a nice golden grain flavor on the aftertaste. Some decent lacing for a pilsner. Fairly light on carbonation. Clear gold color. Aroma is very faint, almost unnoticeable. Almost all the taste on this one is post-swallow. I think I'll have another."
1583,47604,Augustiner719,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. Got this as an extra, cant remember who but thank you very much if you read this. Pours a beautiful red brown color with hop haze and a massive, massive head. almost thought it was infected at how much head there was and the retention lasts forever. Smells bready with just a slight spicy note from the rye. has a touch of lemony hops as well. Tastes a touch sweet, but has a good hop bite to it. sorta has that hombrewed sweetness to it. Love the light body with caramel malts. I would have thought it was an amber ale to be honest with some hops added. Nothing crazy for the style but the key here is that its balanced well. Mouthfeel is decent with that medium carbonation retaining in the actual liquid after the massive head recedes. This is a very drinkable beer, just nothing to go running for. not sure of the price but if its a qpr then maybe its worth a shot to seek out. nice job though."
1584,47604,SpdKilz,"Appearance - Pours into my SA Perfect Pint with a dark amber hue. Over two fingers of tan, fluffy head is achieved with a moderate pour. The head is slowly dissipating, leaving decent lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell - Slight hops, floral, citrus [i.e. grapefruit], and sweet maltiness. Honestly, it also smells quite literally just like marijuana (after a few big intakes of the nose, one can most definitely smell the ""dankness"" to this drink). Taste - Flavor smells similar to the nose but overall muted. It is a bit sweeter than most other IPAs but not in a way that detracts from the overall drink. Not much rye can be found after numerous sips. There is plenty of grapefruit, sweet malts, and pine. Not horrible by any means but just nothing that really jumps out at you. Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Drinkability - Pretty quaffable. This is by no means a bad IPA, however, as someone else stated previously, for the price there is no reason to buy it. For the same price I could have opted to get a Blind Pig which was right next to this (but I wanted to try something new). Again, I'm glad I tried it but with so many other great West Coast D/IPA's out there, I won't be getting this again."
1585,47604,RoyalT,"Appearance - This is a thick, murky light brown in color with a faint orangish tint and a brown-white head that was almost as thick as the beer itself. Smell - There's a lot going on in here. The hops jump out first. They are mainly citrus in character but with a very bitter slant. They are incredibly creamy on the nose if that's possible and there's a sharpness to them that you don't often find. The malt base is rank in a very good way. The rye comes out husky and quite tight to the smell. Beneath it all is a rich sweetness that again smells very tight. All of this malty goodness play especially well with the hops. Taste - The hops and malts play nice at the taste, too. The hops lose some of their sharpness that I got from the nose but are still large. The malts are just wonderful though and especially that sweet character came threw beautifully at the taste. It is all just the right mix of citrus hops, malts, light non-grainy rye, and sugar. Mouthfeel - This is huge in the mouth. I wouldn't call it full-bodied but definitely medium on the big side. The carbonation is light and appropriate. There is some light bitterness throughout but this is not a bone-crushing bitter drink like some IPAs. Drinkability - With a modest 6.2% ABV this is definitely a session ale. It is very smooth yet big and chewy and has enough complexity to keep things entertaining. I definitely enjoyed this better than most as it is only averaging an overall score of 3.5 or so and I thought it was way above that grade. Big, heavy, and harmonious."
1586,47604,chickencoop,"Picked this up at Whole Foods/ i left my wallet in El Segundo, pretty solid beer selection with a nice emphasis on locals. The pour on this was a big hazy orange, almost Widmer Heffe like, which is strange since some of the previous reviews had it translucent and almost clear. I liked to citrusy smell, which balances with the malty taste, almost to a creamy feel. This was quite drinkable, my only concern is that these guys are inconsistant with what hit's the market and how each bottle or batch is different. I got a good one, i'll be back. Just an update, I can't stop buying this stuff."
1587,47604,shivtim,"Thanks for the bottle, Konrad! I like the color scheme on the bottle; it fits the name. Poured it out into a pint glass. It's surprisingly translucent, with not the tiniest hint of haze. Small streams of bubbles. Looks like tea water; a simple golden yellow with slight red tinges, and a tiny ring of white head on top. Nose has a sharp sweet fruit smell, like apple and pear. This layer is almost like a cider. Some hops come through as well, but it's dominated by the sugary fruit. Taste is sweet malty flavors, vaguely pineapple. Lingering hops come in at the end to remind that it's an IPA, but they are very gentle. I can't pick up on the rye. Very gentle mustiness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both average. Overall not bad, just doesn't seem to fit the rye or IPA categories."
1588,47604,coldmeat23,"GLASS: Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 55 degrees Thanks to RodBurg for the Bootlegger's Brewery hook-up! This is a lightly hazy, golden brown colored liquid, with a slight orange cast to it. A one-finger, off-white colored, head of foam sits on top. Retention is fairly good, but is gone before the glass hits the halfway point. Lacing is good in appearance, but is very slippery. Lots of citrus hops notes, blended with a boatload of caramel presence. Almost has a butterscotch(?!) quality to it. Light spice notes and a biscuity yeast presence. The sweetness of butterscotch/caramel hits first and lingers for awhile. Just when you think that nothing is going to happen, in comes a good kiss of citrus hops, bringing a touch of bitterness with it. The yeast is still present, but it's somewhat buried. There is a nice hint of rye spice coming through, but not nearly as much as I had anticipated/expected. The body is medium at best, but I'd probably put it in the high end of light bodied. The carbonation is medium level. It has a crisp sharpness to it. The body is a letdown, to me. It's quite drinkable, but it's really just kind of a lackluster beer. I hate saying that, because I really hoped to like it. If I want something completely inoffensive that I don't have to think about the multiple layers of, this would be on the list, sadly."
1589,47604,snpub540,"Poured a clear light copper hue with an eggshell colored head. Left little lacing on the glass during the drink however. Smell was a faint floral hoppiness with some sweet malty notes as well. Not much going on there. Taste was a balanced between the malts and the hops. Upfront some caramel malt and a slight rye spice flavor. Hops were crisp and refreshing in the finish. Floral hops were the majority, with a slight grassiness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and made for a refreshing thirst quencher. Drinkability was good because of the balance. Not too much hop bite, but not to much malt sweetness. Alcohol flavor is subdued, and this probably could be a session beer."
1592,47604,dardan,"Perfectly respectable IPA, though the Rye aspect is not as pronounced as some of the competition. A: Clear golden, good foam & lacing, sediment remained in bottle, S: Hops with a little malt, appropriate for an IPA, T: Hoppy but little rye character, a good example of an IPA, M: Clean and crisp, appropriately West Coast IPA, D: Easy to drink, slight alcohol in back may slow down some. Not the greatest Rye IPA on the market, but good, clean taste, aroma, and IPA character make it well worth trying."
1593,47604,womencantsail,"On-tap at Bootlegger's A: The pour is an orangish-yellow color with a nice white head on top, which sticks around for quite awhile. S: The smell is primarily citrus hops (grapefruit) with a touch of caramel but no rye notes to speak of. T: The taste is a bit better than the nose. The grapefruit hops are there along with a somewhat mild bitterness. The caramel malt provides a bit more sweetness than I'm used to in an IPA, but not bad. Again, no rye to be found. M: Medium in body with moderate carbonation. D: This IPA isn't too bad, but not necessarily one of the better west coast incarnations. The name is also a bit misleading as I really failed to detect any of the usual rye characteristics."
1594,47604,augustgarage,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head shaped pint glass. ""Rustic"" suggests that the brewer lacks confidence in this beer - the dent in the bottle-cap (were these hand-capped?) further adds to the ""homebrew"" feel. Safety orange liquid with some chill haze - topped by a billowing finger of off-white foam. Excellent lacing and decent retention. Caramel, citrus, and rye flour aromas - floral and earthy but somewhat subdued. Bitterness is assertive, though the hop flavors are not particularly complex. Tangerine, grass flowers, and floral/herbal notes combine with honey or caramel malt. The rye adds a touch of sourness in the finish almost like buckwheat. Spritzy carbonation, not quite medium-bodied, and very ""zippy"" mouthfeel. A good effort which I would be happy to have again - though not in the same league as Alpine Nelson."
1595,47604,DogFood11,"22oz brown bottle. I'm a sucker for Rye Ipa's dating back to the grand daddy of them all Bear Republics Hop rod rye. Poured into a small tulip it is an inviting dark copper color with a frothy, meaty off white head. The nuts and bolts of this brew come up short. Its lacking any depth and is kind of thin for this style. Rye stands out boldly and in this its moderate to mild. Mouthfeel is also light with some lingering some distracting sticky malt. Notes: Not for me. A great style. I'm glad more brewery's are attempting the RYE IPA but this needs some work."
1596,47604,GRG1313,"Pours a clear dark orange amber with a beautiful thick and firm white head. Nose is medium sweet and floral grapefruit with a hint and undertone of ripe pineapple. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and with a very nice body. Flavors are actually very much like a rye bread in nature-rye grain flavor with extremely well balanced malt and fruit. Finish is long and with a bitter rye grapefruit character. Very consumer friendly and food friendly with a very nice character, flavor profile and finish. Finish goes on forever and gets more and more bitter for a minute or two."
1597,47604,Overlord,"Pours a golden, orange-ish yellow with a big white foam head. Smells ... where's the rye? Smells like some tropical IPA notes, just a hint, and ... maybe some grapefruit. Kind of muted. Flavor is similarly uninspiring. It's sweeter than a normal IPA, but I don't know if that's from the Rye, or what, because I detect basically no Rye. Some grapefruit, some sweet malt, but a bit grainy. Well ... it's not bad, but too expensive for what it is."
1598,47604,mentor,"Pours a 3 finger nearly white head over a mildly cloudy copper liquid. Smells piney and tropical hop aroma with some musty rye character. Tastes juicy tropical flavors from hops with sweet malt undertones and an earthy sting/edge from the rye. Hop flavor is mostly lemon and blood orange with some pineapple and pine. Comes across a bit acidic and is accompanied by a mild alcohol sting (quite clean). Esters are minimal and hop bitter is strong and clean. The hop bitter blends with the alcohol and acidic well, but the hop flavors are too over the top. The finish falls flat with a lack of flavors. Would be nice to have a grassy hop bitterness to keep the palatte engaged. Md-light body with some dextrinous character. Strong carbonation is detracting. Decent beer."
1599,47604,glid02,"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, CA. Pours a nice copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing. Smells of pale malts with good amounts of citrus hops and light hints of spicy rye. Tastes very similar to how it smells. Pale malt flavors up front with hints of rye are joined shortly by light citrus flavors. Midway through the sip the rye gains a bit of strength before fading to a mildly bitter ending. Mouthfeel is good. It has a nice thickness with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. I finished my glass fairly quickly and could have another. Overall this is a solid Rye IPA that I could session and enjoy it. Worth a shot."
1600,47604,PizzaQueen1,"I think Bootlegger's has done a great job with making an IPA that everyone can enjoy. So many beer drinkers that are stepping out for the first time are afraid of IPA's because they are over-the-top in flavor. The color is a cloudy/light carmel hue. It pours beautifully from a tap, leaving a moderate head of foam. The carbonation is great too, making it very sippable. Love the opening citrus notes and has that IPA bitter finish, but not over-powering. Making it perfect for different types of food pairings. I have had many other IPA's, and while they were good, I did not want another glass. Bootlegger's has an IPA that you can drink more than 1 glass and it is not too much."
1601,47604,magictrokini,"Pours a murky golden-brown with a total lack of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is flat, grainy, and plain. Some floral hops, but no rye to speak of. Some sourness, more metallic than anything else. Good mouthfeel, firm but not thick or syrupy. Decent carbonation. Taste makes up in part for what is lacking. Smooth, sweet, fruity hop flavor. Tropical and blood orange hop taste, but nothing tangy or bitter. Attribute that to the overmalted backing. Very sweet for the style. As for the rye, again, it is nearly nonexistent. Compared to a similar beer, Hop Rod Rye, this is weak and rye-free. However, this beer tastes really good. I could drink this again and again, but it misses the boat stylisticly."
1602,47604,hopdog,"22oz bottle acquired in trade with Hophead22 (thanks!). Poured a Medium and slightly hazy amberish-orangish color with an averaged sized off white head. Armoas of rye, grains, a little earthy, and citrus. Tastes of rye, grains, citrus, ans some caramel. Had a light tart and sour finish that I too liked."
1604,83430,jrenihan,"Beer is orange/yellow in colour. No head. Cloudy. Smell is musty and funky. A bit of cheese scent. Not a very nice funk, as ""funk"" scents go. Taste is sour, with yeast and a funky flavour. Light fruit, lemon. Brett. Light bodied, low carbonation. Very tart. Overall, decent but not a great beer. Smell in particular leaves something to be desired."
1609,276550,Boccu,"Pours opaque burnt orange with one finger white head that fades slowly. Nice lacing that clings to the sides of the snifter. Aroma of tropical fruit and hops. Taste follows the nose with pineapple, mango, citra and oats. Silky mouth feel. Really tasty."
1611,276550,SDRedDevil,"I mean where do you start with this beer....the addition of lactose and use of Cashmere hops made me a bit skeptical up front. Pours a hazy tangerine color with a pungent tropical aroma. Basically this is a citra, nelson bomb floating on a bed of oats with a hint of lactose to give it a smooth creamy finish. Its basicallyperfect, juicy in the right spots, smooth, crushable for 8%. OH with a home run here...."
1613,276550,cfalls,"L - mostly opaque, straw color, one finger head fades away S - mango, white grape, a little bread, and a faint burnt rubber kind of thing, medium overall pungency T - sweet and bitter are nicely balanced, with a lot of fruity hop flavors F - great creaminess, medium carbonation, slight burn O - I slightly preferred this over the Suparillo from the same release, which was also great"

1622,191226,jzlyo,"Aroma is strong orange, mild sweetness and slightly perfumed fruit. The flavor is orange/citrus/slightly cola-ish, malts and mildly bland/sweet finish."
1627,191226,superspak,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/24/2016. Pours hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pear, apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pear, apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate yeast spiciness and slight fruit bitter/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blood orange, orange peel, coriander, pepper, wheat, cracker, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and solid robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a nice malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is good; a bit thin even for a witbier. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.1%. Overall this is a very solid fruited witbier. All around good balance and solid robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, blood orange, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
1629,191226,mooseisloose,"Popping the top on this brew I get a big waft of oranges and a little bit of breadiness. Pours to a light golden color with not much of a head. On the taste this brew is like a wit beer up front but quickly has a very pronounced orange soda like flavor in the back of the throat with a bit of bitterness to go with it. Something different, nothing spectacular, but not offensive."
1630,191226,tfsimpkins,Very very floral on the nose and palate. The yeast characteristics do not mesh well with the blood orange rind flavors. Almost soapy. Maybe its the belgian wit yeast? May they can try an abbey or belgian ale yeast blend?
1631,191226,RicketyCrix,"If you enjoy the taste of a wonderfully crafted citrus Lysol type cleaner product, then I have the beer for you! Seriously though the artificial orange taste is awful, had to pour this one down the drain,"
1634,191226,Chris1108,Meh. In every category. I do not like wheat beer and I didnt realize it was a wheat until after I drank one and looked it up on BA. It does not say on the label. The orange is mildly present but tastes so artificial it makes me think this beer is artificially flavored. Overall Drain pour 2.2/5.
1635,191226,Lousmistress,"The first sip turned my stomach from all the soapy taste. I cleansed my palate, took a small sip, spit it back into glass, and poured it down the drain. I will never buy or try that beer again, and quite possibly the same for all Shipyard products. There are too many soapy reviews!!"

1638,62936,JayS2629,Cloudy orange/amber color with a foamy white head that fades slowly and has beautiful lacing. The smell is mild for an IPA but has all the right elements. Citrus and pine with some floral hints and herbal notes. Caramel taste up front with some biscuit and a nice citrus punch at the back. A very mild and easy to drink IPA.
1639,62936,Huhzubendah,"On draft at the brewpub. The beer appears very hazy and dark orange with very little head and no lacing. The aroma is of sweet, burnt malt. The flavor is devoid of hops and tastes like overly sweet burning candy. The feel is OK, but it's near impossible to get past the aroma and flavor. Avoid."
1641,125646,DrGonzo,"Great beer. Not sure how it's currently 100 rated, but it for sure is an excellent beer. What separates this beer from other stellar offerings from Alchemist, Trillium, Other Half etc... is the resinous finish. It finishes with a strong bitter, resin taste but it quickly dissipates. Outstanding smooth mouth feel, explosion of hops and fruits in the taste and smell. Excellent beer, well worth the wait."

1644,125646,cmurphy7,"had this from a 2L growler. The look of this beer is truly amazing. almost orange in hue. the scent is also spectacular with heavy fruity notes. If that is your bag (i.e. super fruity NE IPAs) than this is the perfect beer. growler brew did go pretty flat very quickly, but this is probably not unique to Treehouse brews."
1645,125646,Antg8989,"My 500th Beer! Look: Pours a golden peachy haze; white head. Tiny bit of lacing. Aroma: A blend of orange, peach, papaya and pineapple. Taste: It's complex - definitely need to have a precise palate for this one. Tropical and Stone fruits and some interesting yeast. Feel: Highly carbonated, soft and heavy. Overall: I know from tasting this beer how good it is - but I can't figure out exactly why. It's the kind of beer that makes me realize I need to get a beer tasting certification to know what's really going on."
1648,125646,BertGib11,"Pours a nice hazy medium gold with creamy head. The smell is amazing. You can taste mango, peach, pineapple and tropical fruits. So good"
1657,125646,Ffd356,0% Probably my favorite Treehouse brew. Excellent aroma and goes down even better. One a day keeps the doctor away!
1661,125646,BeerGuy8315,"Poured from a can into a snifter. Canned 3/22/17. A: Pours a super hazy, pale orange in color with a one inch, frothy, paper white head with good retention. Thick, white, billowy lacing throughout. S: Aromas of grapefruit, orange, melons, and guava accompanied by earthy, floral, and piney hops. T: Starts off with notes of grapefruit and citrus followed by peach, guava, and papaya. Finishes with a light piney, resinous hop bitterness. F: Medium bodied. Smooth. Minimal carbonation. Somewhat dry. O: Overall, this is a good DIPA, but I was actually somewhat let down with all the hype. Juicy hop profile and flavor depth was somewhat lacking for me given the reputation. Still a good brew, but I prefer Julius and KJ by a mile. Also, if VH has fairly similar traits I have difficulty seeing how it holds a number one spot."
1663,125646,Bush33186,Great beer. Thoroughly enjoyed trading for this. Would love to have again can't wait until I come across Very Hazy.
1668,125646,DavidR_9,"16oz can (packaged on 3/20/17) poured into belgian tulip glass. Beautiful medium gold completely hazed body with a thick finger and a half of head with great retention and lacing. This beer really comes through with the sticky delicious citrus and fruity hop aroma followed by amazing pineapple, peach, and orange juice flavors. Mouthfeel is very balanced, carbonation on point and no alcohol to be detected. Every sip of this brew was a delight and I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to try a beer that emulates my favorite juice of all (orange)."
1676,125646,Boccu,"Pours deep orange. Nice lacing. Aroma strong hops. Taste hops,tropical fruits,peach mango and pineapple. Mouth feel is silky. Another beast. Treehouse never disappoints."

1680,47604,Halcyondays,"22 oz. bomber, a RyePA, A: Pours a lightly hazy amber, with a really light white head, real nice sunset colour. S: All hops, no hint of rye. Nice light citrus, smells like a regular IPA. T: The rye certainly comes in in the taste. Great spicy character adds complexity to the solid hop profile. Tangerine, orange, tropical notes from the hops are all there. Malt is treacly, almost cake batter at times. A really good mix of flavours. M: Smooth, creamy, robust, dry finish. D: A real nice surprise out of the local brewery in Fullerton, Bootlegger's. I'm going to have to try their whole lineup now with how good this was."
1681,47604,athensbeermaster,"Starts off with a dense lt. brown head. The nose has big citrus notes with a big rye bread aroma. The head retention is good some nice lacing on the glass. The taste: Good malty toasted rye bread flavors,a dry lemon rind mixed with a hint of blood orange gives to a good mid-palate fruit. The malt backbone softens into sweet dates and spicy rye finish. Kudos for a great twist on a hoppy classic. Feels good to buy a beer that was brewed down the street from ya!!"
1682,47604,DoubleJ,"This is a new beer in Bootlegger's portfolio, an IPA with 10% rye. It tasted really nice during my tasting at the brewery, so I bought a growler to go. On to the beer: Big patchy/soapy head on top a color of beautiful clearish copper/bronze. Good head retention. Aroma...oh man, that smells good. Very citrusy, grapefruit. It bombards the nostrils. Cracks of dry biscuit and caramel. The taste is simply a good thing. It's quite balanaced, tasty...don't worry the hops sneak in towards the back. This is a very complex beer. At first, it has a slight tropical fruit flavor with a gummy feel and caramel flavors. Bready, strong earthy notes, and drying in the middle, probably from the rye, yet the hop flavor pokes through. This becomes a strong floral flavor towards the back. Very clean and dry in the finish. The easy-going mouthfeel helps things out here, and feels as light as a feather with just a tick of carbonation. It's good to find a slight twist on a popular style, particularly for the better. This is clocked at 85 IBU's, yet feels like half of that. Simply put, it is very tasty and easy to drink. I wonder how this will fare when its bottled soon? (2/25/11) - Had it again from a growler. More unbalanced than I remember. Still very clean and hoppy though."
1689,47606,Halcyondays,"On-tap at Beachwood I, A: Pours a dark brown, more than black. The colour is a problem in an Impy Stout. Soft light tan head, spotty lace. S: Firm medium dark chocolate, hint of roast and coffee. T: Muddled baker's chocolate with some brown sugar play. No real hop flavour, a bit awkward here. M: Creamy, maybe even too much so, frothy, medium-bodied. O: An average Imperial Stout for the most part, has it's problems, but a drinkable rendition of the style."
1690,47606,FosterJM,"463rd review on BA Draft App- This was pleanty dark but just looked a bit watery in the glass. A small swirl gave a little bit of bubbles. Smell- A bit light for a double stout with some watered down malts and some chocolate notes. Taste- Was pretty good nice balance and some sweet with the chocolate and malts but just too light to be a double for me. Mouth- Light/Med. This was way too light on the feel and the beer was medium carbed. Drink- Its a good intro double stout for some people, I wanted to find a new big stout and was a little let down."
1691,47606,notchucknorris,A: Completely black with a tan foam head. S: Lots of roasted malts and a bit of coffee. T: Pretty good representation of the style. Lots of roasted malts and coffee and a bit of milk chocolate sweetness before finishing on a pretty bitter coffee note.
1692,47606,broken22,This is the first airdale beer I have had. It was a special event at a local watering hole that had this darkness paired up with bacon chocolate donuts. I got there early to make sure that I got a glass of this stuff. Now let's review this brew. This beer is dark. It looks like motor oil coming out of the ground. A nice thick creamy head formed on the pour. The head died down pretty quickly offering up the deliciousness bubbling below. Even though the head died down it never fully left. It just knew its place was out of the way and towards the rim of the glass.This beer has that sweet smell only a nice strong dark beer has. I imagine this is also because of the higher alcohol content. This beer has a crisp bitter finish that grabs your throat. I was actually quite surprised at the sharpness the flavor had on first sip. This is definitely not a beer for those that don't really enjoy dark beers. Since this beer was on cask the carbonation was perfect. It was perfect in that there was not a lot of it. While the description of this beer says that there is coffee and cocoa nibs in this thing they are not as pronounced as other beers I have had stating the same contents. I was first kind of bummed about that but then warmed up to the idea that they just bucked my expectations of what a beer made with coffee and cocoa nibs should taste like. Their idea is more in the bitter realms. Overall this was a good beer. While not my favorite I still really enjoyed it. I said earlier that this is not a beer for those that don't normally drink dark beers. Case and point my friend that accompanied me ended up giving me his beer to finish after only the first sip. I was only too happy to help him out. This beer was going fast and it did pair well with the bacon chocolate donuts.
1693,47606,srandycarter,"A - Near black 1/4 inch tan head. Tight bubble cling lace. S - Chocolate/cocoa mostly with some coffee element in there. T - Taste matches smell, though much lighter than smell would imply. M - Creamy, low carb, good balance, lighter body. D - A very easy to drink beer, especially considering the apparent ABV."
1694,47606,Dijeriduster,"Surprising that this is scoring so low here?? A - Very dark brown to black with solid thick head. Lacing present as well. S - Nice and dark with lots of the roasted grains coming thru. Some hops present but you can tell already its the grains staring here. T - Quite good. Some RIS's can be syrupy and is anything but with a nice full profile holding up the grains. A hint of booze is also present - true to style. M - Great, nice and smooth so you can taste the full profile. D - Pretty good for an RIS. I wouldn't sit down over a pint of Rasputins or Stone RIS without first warming the palate on a ""smaller"" beer - but the Airdale holds up well and is wonderful paired with food..."
1698,191226,cjgator3,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The aroma reminds is citrusy but comes across as unnatural. The best I can describe the nose is orange or grapefruit dish soap. The taste is disappointing as well. In fact, there is something in the taste that is bitter and medicinal that is extremely off-putting to me and I am having a hard time finishing the bottle. I drank it all but it got more difficult with each sip and it was darn near a drain pour. Overall, this is not something I will purchase again."
1700,191226,hophugger,"A nice flavored belgian beer with a light color, decent head and aroma. Flavor is very nice bllod orange and I even get the feel of the peel on my lips at the end. A touch soapy, but a nice very refreshing beer for the summer...........or anytime !!"
1701,191226,CTHomer,"A: somewhat hazy; deep gold in color; 1 finger white head that receded quickly to nothing; no lacing; S: somewhat skunky with some blood orange behind it; T; coriander and blood orange from start to finish; combination doesn't really work for me; very little bitterness; M: medium bodied; lightly carbonated; O: I love blood oranges, but this isn't worth it;"
1703,191226,Zylod,"Nice and golden with a bit of head. Smells like...a creamsavers orange...which well..i like those so...good for me....taste follows up...Heavy front kick of orange and bitter going out, not bad..some bubbles in the body. Not bad at all, it's basically what it claims to be. If it's not your taste you prolly will not like it, if it is you will. I like it."
1705,369858,Hopheadjeffery,"Tasted in a tall tulip from draft at 1840 Brewing Company on September 7, 2018. Munich Helles is one of our favorite styles of light lager. Incredibly crisp and balanced, it is the perfect end of Summer crusher. Expect bright malt, hop and yeast flavors in this unfiltered lager."
1706,367068,dcscientist,"Saisons can encompass a wide variety of flavors, and this one is very piney. It's clear, not hazy, and you don't get a lot of the esters coming out, but you definitely get the dry finish it promises. If you like this style of saison, you'll really enjoy this beer."
1708,248397,Buck89,"Batch no. 5 on the bottle, purchased in July. Nice looking beer. Lightly hazy medium-amber color with a one-finger white head that settled quickly into a wispy lacy cap. The nose was complex and showed orange, pine, oak, and some leathery funk. The taste was funky through and through with a leathery dry mustiness. Underneath and quite present were the hoppy IPA notes I expected, as described in the aroma. The oak became prominent near the finish and left a lasting impression. Very dry and somewhat warm but not boozy. Much more of a hoppy Brett beer than an IIPA. Very interesting."
1709,308684,The_Kriek_Freak,"A slightly hazy yellow IPA, with not as much mango as you would expect given the inclusion of mango. Some mild dank notes but overall a very straightforward IPA. Nice mouthfeel with little carbonation and a smooth, creamy coating of the tongue."
1711,191226,puboflyons,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of 08-31-16. Sampled on May 8, 2016. The pour is straw yellow with a modest, white foamy head. Some haze. On the nose there is toasted bread, Pilsener malts, grass, hay, wheat flakes, and a dash of orange. The body is light to medium. The orange is much more forward and sweet in the taste than in the aroma. It is ore like an orange cream. The wheat and grassy hop characters take second placed to the orange zest. Some light allspice. Mild bitterness to finish"
1714,191226,Trosevear,"L: Has a hazy yellow colour to it with a slight amount of orange to it, big poof head with that leaves some really nice lacing down the side. S: Sweet and tangy orange has almost no hop smell to it at all. T: Tangy orange with no bitterness to it, has a definite blood orange taste to it. F: a regular amount of carbonation on the younger which makes the beer taste better in my opinion. O: a really good beer, could slam back a lot of these fast on the deck on a hot day."
1715,191226,Slatetank,I tried this from the bottle in a tumbler The color is light golden amber with practically no head with a ring of bubbles. The smell has a tangy fruity scent with slight fruity yeast ester with subtle wheat smell. The feel has medium tanginess with moderately low carbonation with slight sweetness with light spice and toasted texture with semi-dry finish. The taste has mild fruity flavor with gentle citrus tanginess with slight coriander peppery and light malt sweetness with subtle yeast flavor to augment the toasted wheat in the flavor with blood orange mild in general. This is a decent wheat beer with orange milder than expected it has some Belgian yeast character but that is mild too if that is what is supposed to be Belgian style about it
1718,191226,biboergosum,"12oz bottle - a witbier, sure, until the 'natural flavors added' bit in the ingredients list. This beer pours a hazy, medium golden yellow colour, with three fingers of puffy, finely foamy, and mildly creamy bone-white head, which leaves some streaky welding arc lace around the glass as it quickly sinks out of sight. It smells of sharp orange flesh and peel, grainy, semi-sweet wheat malt, rather sugary coriander, a touch of earthy yeast, and a faint leafy and floral hop bitterness. The taste is bready and doughy pale and wheat malt, a sturdy fleshy orange fruitiness, still saccharine coriander spice notes, battened-down yeast, and more tame floral and weedy hoppiness. The carbonation is fairly active in its coddling and enveloping frothiness, the body a decent middleweight, and mostly smooth, with a small airy creaminess arising as things warm up a tad. It finishes well off-dry, the still heady mixed malt contending with the equally lingering sugared spice thing to see who can make me scrape my tongue first. Overall, a simple and plain version of the style, one that seems at times overburdened by the aforementioned 'natural' flavouring, which must have been some sort of sweetened orange concentrate. Good, if you like your alco-pops, but for fans of the expected subtly of the style, this one will not please."
1719,178983,azdenverdanimal,Yum yum in my tum tum!!
1720,47606,magictrokini,"Tap @ Toronado SD. Poured black with a ring of tan bubbles. Not much lacing. Weak aroma of toasted malt, dark chocolate, cocoa, and earthy hops. Loose mouthfeel, especially for the style. Watered-down coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Some roasted malt, but it leaned into the burnt cereal grain variety. The hop bitterness was lost in the coffee. When I had this, I initially thought it was a regular stout. If it WAS an American Stout, it would be decent. However, as a RIS, its not even close."
1721,47606,jgap,"At Coronado Brewery (it was a tough call not to get a Coronado brew but I had a bunch earlier in the week so that I could try this one and not feel like I was missing out on some Islander or Mermaid and they were out of Idiot). Sorry, I thougt the explanation was warranted... Poured black with a nice, grey lace. Smell is a mixture of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of some dark fruits. Taste is a slight coca up front fading to a coffee/hoppy bitterness that lingers for a time before turning to a hint of dark, ripe fruit. A hint of alcohol is in the finish but the aftertaste trails off quickly. Mouthfeel is a on the lighter side of medium with a good amount of carbonation but not too much (I like thick stouts, however). Pretty good beer for a young brewery- worth a try"
1722,47606,seaoflament,"Had some of this on tap last night at La Bella, thanks Danny. After having their Homecoming Porter, which is quite good, I wanted to try their imperial stout. Very good presentation, dark with about a half inch of fluffy foam. The head has some great retention as well. A little too cold at first and couldn't pick up much aroma so I let it warm up for a couple of minutes. After I revisited the beer I picked up some chocolate and espresso notes right away. Then some roasted barley come through and roasted malts but I didn't find too much complexity in the aroma. Later on I started to detect a sort of grainy aroma in the background. The taste was a little better than the aroma. With the first sip I got some roasted malts and chocolate malts upfront followed closely by some chocolate covered raisins, fruity and dark malts in the middle, and espresso in the finish. Good but not much to stand out from the pack. Low carbonation and the body felt a tad thin in the end. The alcohol was well hidden though. Didn't impress me as much as their Homecoming Porter but would still like to revisit this one."
1725,47630,smcolw,"Crystal clear straw color. Very nice. Nearly no head (rim bubbles). Some spots for lace. Interesting grapefruit smell (probably from the hop). Pale malted grain in the background. Spicier than most pilsners. Starts with a solid pale malt base. More rich than most but it has a good level of carbonation. Moderate aftertaste blending the two main elements. Overall, rather nondescript for the style, but still easy to drink."
