      "Revisiting this ale nearly 5 years since my first encounter, this bottle's BB date is... DEC. 2017! Served cool in Gulden Draak's tulip-shaped bowl sniffer. A: super dark russet brown hue with mahogany shines, coming with a moderate carbonated body and a nicely lingering beige frothy head. S: very different from the Wee Heavy tasted immediately before this - Orkney Skullsplitter - the aroma here is not so pronounced in its overripe-fruit departments; it's low-profiled, more distinctive with a clear highlight of the yeastiness, comprising touches of cheese, salty-sweet butterscotch and a yeasty-maltiness not unlike a robust and estery Belgian dark ale. The sour hint of Chinese herbed prunes provides a suitable balancer with the yeasty hints as well as with the rich yet underlying flow of overripe fruitiness (prunes, apples, and figs mainly). T: a clean entry of faintly raisiny, sour black dates and black-sugary dark malts comes not sweet at all and pretty understated in taste actually, then the flavour seamlessly ventures into a slightly herbal and bitter aftertaste backed by a distinctive edge of wood-barrel ageing. In the finish, black sugar and a touch of dried herbs are coupled with a rather... \"tannic\"-chewy palate as of sour-yeastiness or wood-barrel ageing. Somehow, the complexity is not so... great in this bottle, but the overall impression is still all positive. M&D: fine and smooth on the carbonation, the body is medium at most, and it drinks absolutely light for a 7.2%abv. ale, although it does lack a kind of \"soul\" (or a really soft palate) that is the key to a \"live\" British ale. Compared with my first encounter almost 5 years ago, I'd say (just like with Orkney's Skullsplitter) this ale can't give me that \"oomph\" effect anymore; but before I get to taste the cask-version (should it be available), I'd still revisit this unique and special ale whenever possible. The balance and integrity are the strengths of this ale, no doubt about it. * Tasting Date: 13/10/05 Obtained this bottle from the London branch of the Royal Mile Whiskies Shop. BB date: DEC. 2014!!! Gosh, for a beer at just 7.2%abv. to boast this level of longevity takes incredible courage as well as unlimited self-confidence I think... 4.5 A: served in a big tulip-shaped wine glass, it pours a very dark, elegant ruby hue, with an initially thick beige head slowly dissipating and settling down to a thin layer of tight froth - looking very elegant for a British bottled beers~~ 5 S: the nose is incredibly malty and complex - profoundly sweet, but not intrusive, syrupy dark maltiness prevails along with a complex dark-fruit aroma mixed of preserved sweet date, plum jam and huge juicy raisins; plus a barley-candyish texture smelling so thick and delicious enough to eat... also at present is butterscotch note, or that profound buttery note of, guess what, Scottish shortbread... Overall, creamy, rich, rounded, laced with so many dark fruits while avoiding being overly sweet and thick; if only some exotic Belgian yeasts were used this beer could smell more complex and satisfying than a great bunch of Belgian strong dark ales! 4.5 T: full-bodied and almost oily-smooth texture of dark-maltiness and an intense flow of dark-fruitiness make a big entrance, bringing on board lots of buttery toffee, a tinge of roastiness, caramelised sugar, a rounded, bittersweet walnuty flavour, leaving a slowly intensifying dryish-bitterness as well as a mildly spicy-bitter touch developing at the deep end of the tongue; a slightly syrupy mouthfeel is left in the end, but not OTT, and the alc. touch is very restrained, only emerging deep down the throat at the very last, rather than from the beginning. 4.5 M: creamy, silky-smooth texture throughout; actually it tastes much much lighter and delicate for a 7.2%abv. malty brew... at the same time, the body is rich enough to buttress the full-flavour, and helps achieve a nice balance on the palate. 4.5 D: overall, this is an ultra-elegant beer with so much to offer - neither something you'd wish to savour every day, nor even for the second bottle on the same night - because it's so precious and rare, worth great patience until having next sip, and next bottle. Reviewing it \"within style\", I give it such high score over here, to reflect the fact that though this is just my second bottle of Wee Heavy, I already love it so much. Highly recommended!\n",

      "It's time for another \"Good Idea, Bad Idea\". Good idea, drinking and reviewing awesome beers on BA. Bad idea, the existence of this beer. Well it's that time again, time for another Jared's Bad Beer Review. In this session, St. Pauli Girl, what I remember as being the most foul thing I've ever put into my mouth from years ago, the first and only time I've ever touched this thing. I almost wanted to skunk it more for the fun, but why bother. It's bad enough I'm sure. They even have the date on there, best by 03/2012, so it can't be that bad, can it?! And the cap is removed, no going back now. The pour yields a pasty white 1.5 finger fizzy but creamy semi thick but bubbly head, reminiscent of albino sperm, and fades with actual sperm like lacing. The beer is more clear than Boston water, less brown as well, it's golden colored like a fake tan. Nose, well not quite as bad as I remember actually. I'm a little turned off by not throwing up as I breath it in. It's actually somewhat breathable. I get some faint cracked straw and pilsner like malts, that breath a light juiciness almost as if it were at one point made with actual beer. Just a hint of skunked lager, not much by way of horridness actually. Granted I did pull this right out of a non-light penetrating case from a fridge, and directly into my fridge so very little light exposure. A light Bavarian malt aroma really seals the deal as an actual beer. Even the hops... wait just kidding, no hops were harmed in the making of this beer. Taste goes down hill a bit, but again not the super skunked re-vomited anal leakage I remember it being. It is pretty watery, more so than most German pilsners (real ones that is). Light cracked straw blends with watered pilsner malt and a hint of sweetness to bring real flavor to it. A decent lager crispness as well, but no real fruity flavors. As it rolls off my tongue faster and smoother than water (as it mostly it just water), the light flavor and mostly lack of flavor turn to a light hint of bitterness, with maybe a hint of grassy hops, I think they waved the 10 year old hops over the beer and a few lupulin glands fell in. Then a bit of a metallic twinge kicks in, just when I thought this beer was actually going to be refreshing. The metallic flavor really lingers making me have to go back and sip more so the watered down straw is overpowering the \"just chewed on tin foil\" flavor and now my mind is bringing the feel of it as well. Oy! Mouth is practically non-existant, FG of like 0.080, and actually not much carbonation either. Overall not as bad as I thought. The metallic flavor on the finish is the real downfall, but not really skunked, and not a huge mess either. I'm glad I tried this again, and did a full review. Perhaps I should give other piss beers a try again. This I would say is worlds better than the macro swill of U.S., and to tell the truth, I'm a little glad it surprised me in a good way. And hell, at least I got some entertainment out of writing this.\n",
